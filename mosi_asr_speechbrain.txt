HEsqda8_d0Q_21	NO GOOD ON YOU LIKE I HAVE FOR DOING THAT
c7UH_rxdZv4_33	DON'T SEE IT
7JsX8y1ysxY_6	I AM REALLY FUNNY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_29	AND THE ACTORS DO SUCH A GOOD JOB OF CARRYING OUT THEIR PARTICULAR ARTS
_dI--eQ6qVU_28	AND I WOULD WANT THE SECRETS TO BE EVEN LONGER RATHER THAN SHORTER
G-xst2euQUc_12	SO WHAT IS STILL A REALLY GREAT MOVE YOU TAKE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TOO
aiEXnCPZubE_10	THE SUPPORTING CAST IS EITHER HIT OR MISS
W8NXH0Djyww_16	ALL THE SUNSETS AND ALL THE LANDSCAPES OF THE FILM THEY JUST LOOK SO REALISTIC AND EVERY ALMOST EVERY SCENE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_1	STILL EXCITED ABOUT IT
1iG0909rllw_9	AND I I DIDN'T REALLY NOW TAKE THAT FROM YOU MEAN AND IN TERMS OF HIS DIRECTION
MLal-t_vJPM_13	HE MIGHT AS WELL
IumbAb8q2dM_10	I'M SO CURIOUS TO SEE I'M HOW THE STORY LINE I GOT TO THAT POINT
jUzDDGyPkXU_10	DESIGNED THE ALIENS IN A REALLY COOL UNIQUE WAY TO MAKE THEM LIKE BIOTIC BUT ALSO MECHANICAL
k5Y_838nuGo_18	WHOM THE GIRLS COULD APPRECIATE AND
tStelxIAHjw_7	LIGHT WALLY
2WGyTLYerpo_45	AND SHE'S NOT A BAD ACTRESS
HEsqda8_d0Q_24	I'M REALLY REALLY REALLY GLAD I SAW HER AND
k5Y_838nuGo_8	AND THAT'S WHY I WAS NOT EXCITED ABOUT THE FOURTH ONE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_28	BUT IT'S GOOD STORY
phBUpBr1hSo_5	ON THE INTERVIEWS A SHY ABOVE SAID THAT THE SECOND MOVIE LACKED A HEART
BvYR0L6f2Ig_22	THIRTY AND NINE
cM3Yna7AavY_12	I DIDN'T REALLY I MEAN TREASURE PLANET WAS O K
Njd1F0vZSm4_11	THEY REALLY NEEDED TO SOMEHOW SET THEM APART WITH ARMOURER
Clx4VXItLTE_11	N SO YOUR ACTIN IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE ONLY GOD YOU WOULDN'T REALLY DO THAT BUT
BioHAh1qJAQ_28	AND CLUE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IDIOTIC VILLAINS EVER GUESSED WHAT IS THAT WHAT IT'S CLUE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_25	SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY GOOD
X3j2zQgwYgE_2	ONLY THINK WHAT THIS WAS MISSING WITH THAT HUMOR AND THAT BEWITCH THAT IS IN THE OTHER STRUCK MOVING
PZ-lDQFboO8_3	IT DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF HUMOR GOING ON WITH IT AT LEAST NONE THAT REALLY MADE YOU WANT TO LAUGH OUT LOUD
Nzq88NnDkEk_24	BEHAVE IF YOU REALLY CAN SPEND SOME MONEY AND GOOD LUCK AND I MAY BE YOU WILL LIKE IT BUT
pLTX3ipuDJI_14	IT'S APPARENTLY SEEN FOR THE AUDIENCE AND THE CHARACTERS
W8NXH0Djyww_26	I WAS GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY I'M
aiEXnCPZubE_26	FIRST THE VISUAL EFFECTS HERE ARE STELLAR
Ci-AH39fi3Y_12	THE GREAT PLOT WAS WITH HOFFMANN TYING UP BALLS LOOSE ENDS AND STUFF
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_6	I DIDN'T FIND IT ALL THAT BAD
zhpQhgha_KU_2	AND I LIKED THE FIRST MEETING WITH THE FIRST MAN WHO WAS FOR THE GOOD
OQvJTdtJ2H4_3	I COULD HAVE MADE YOU A LITTLE LESS SMARTLY IT WAS VERY SHOCKING ON THE
8d-gEyoeBzc_22	I I DON'T THINK HE WAS WELL DEVELOPED ENOUGH AND ALSO I INCLUDE IN THAT LAWRENCE FISHBURN'S CHARACTER AS WELL WHO
9qR7uwkblbs_25	AS A GIANT ASKED TWIST TO THIS MOVING AT THE VERY END LIKE IT'S
Af8D0E4ZXaw_24	THESE TWO DEVELOPMENTS TOGETHER CAUSED WHAT WAS UP TO THAT POINT A NOBLE EFFORT TO START FALLING APART AT THE SEAMS
Bfr499ggo-0_11	IT WILL BE REALLY TOO LOUD
iiK8YX8oH1E_15	IF THERE'S ANY SILVER LINING IN THIS MOVIE IT'S JOHN CHRYSENSKI
Iu2PFX3z_1s_4	HE PUTS THEM IN VERY STRANGE AND UNUSUAL CHARACTERS
d3_k5Xpfmik_1	SOME WHO HAVE NAMED THEMSELVES AFTER THE PLACES AND TO WHICH FOR TRAVELING WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY NICE TORTURE AS
cW1FSBF59ik_18	THE LEAVES SHRIVEL ALIVE AND THE FOSSIL'S NAME IS A LOOKING TREMENDOUSLY AWESOME ACTOR
HEsqda8_d0Q_19	BUT THEN IT'S SO OBVIOUSLY NOT AN ENGLISH CHARACTER
k5Y_838nuGo_4	I LIKE THE FIRST TWO SHARKS QUITE A BIT
VbQk4H8hgr0_37	SO THE CONDITION OF HIS CHARACTER IS PRETTY POINTLESS
k5Y_838nuGo_16	THE FIRST THING WORE A KID RUBIES
1DmNV9C1hbY_9	I'M I'M HERE CAN'T WE GET TO LOVE IT
iiK8YX8oH1E_13	I DON'T THINK SHE'S LEADING MATERIAL
f9O3YtZ2VfI_6	I DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT
BioHAh1qJAQ_19	THE COP THE CORROOGRAPHY OF THE FIGHT'S ESPECIALLY EFFECT I WAS SO HAPPY TO BE BACK IN THE GRID THAT I WAS REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE STORY OR WHERE THE STORY WAS GOING
1iG0909rllw_27	I AM AND MY COUSIN'S ARROW AS WELL AS HE WAS HE WAS RATHER DREADFUL TO WATCH
nbWiPyCm4g0_7	WHERE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT LIES NOT ENTIRELY SURE
8OtFthrtaJM_2	JUST IT'S VERY WELL IT'S VERY CHAOTIC AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE I I
vvZ4IcEtiZc_4	AND THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT MOVIES THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR I MEAN ON THE KING'S SPEECH BLACK SWAN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN HOURS INCEPTION
1iG0909rllw_10	ALL YOU MEAN WAS IT WAS A CASE JUST AVERAGE
Nzq88NnDkEk_19	AND IN AFTER THE MOVIE I'M GOING OUT INTO THE THEATER INTO THE LOBBY I HAD NO ONE I HEARD NO ONE SAY ANYTHING GOOD
tmZoasNr4rU_15	A LOT MORE THAN THE EXPENDABLES BUT
I5y0__X72p0_1	AND I'M PRETTY OPEN DAD TO A BEIN GUTTA
wMbj6ajWbic_25	THE CAPTAIN LOST HAD A LIFE ONE DAY
2WGyTLYerpo_17	THAT THE ACTION IS REALLY CALLED
ZUXBRvtny7o_14	ING WAS REALLY REALLY GREAT TOO
cW1FSBF59ik_5	FREAKING EPOCH AND AN
aiEXnCPZubE_3	SHE IS IN TERRIBLE
ZUXBRvtny7o_21	AND THERE I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE I SEE WHAT IS MOVING BECAUSE
GWuJjcEuzt8_11	BUT THAT'S LIKE THEE YOU KNOW
c7UH_rxdZv4_25	I'M THE SPECIAL FACTS WERE O K
TvyZBvOMOTc_1	WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER NAME FOR THE MOODY
9qR7uwkblbs_22	SHE'S MUST BE AN ANIMAL AND THEN SHE WASN'T
fvVhgmXxadc_7	NOW THAT ALSO TAKES A REALLY CREEPY I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE FACT THAT EMILY BROWNING IN THIS WAY LOOKS LIKE SHE'S UNDER AGE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_25	AND FORD IS ALONG FOR THE RIDE AND HAVING A BLAST AS THE SECOND LEAD
wMbj6ajWbic_6	IN THE GOOD WAY I IN IS THERE'S TWO KINDS OF CHEESY AND THIS IS THE GOOD KIND OF CHEESY YES
wMbj6ajWbic_22	I LIKE IN PARTICULAR JOSEPH'S JESSICA LEVIN HAD A LOT OF FUN OF HIS ROLE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_23	ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S HANGIN OUT THE MERRY MEN WHO ALL BUT ONE OF THEM ARE PROBABLY EARLY TWENTIES AND ONE'S MAY BE MID TWENTIES AND MEANWHILE THERE AIN'T IT WITH POPLAR RUSSELL THAT JUST LOOKS LIKE HE KNOWS WHAT A GUY'S HANGING OUT AND SOME BROTHER DAD ALONG AS HE OFFERED TO
Af8D0E4ZXaw_31	STILL IT'S THAT KIND OF MOVIE MAKING
ob23OKe5a9Q_2	I'D GIVE IT TO HER
d6hH302o4v8_26	ASHES HE'S A VERY DUMB
cXypl4FnoZo_1	AND WHEN YOU SEE RED RIDING HOOD FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND
IumbAb8q2dM_9	AND I REALLY WANT TO GO WITH THE BOOKCASE
cXypl4FnoZo_4	I THOUGHT IT COULD BE REALLY BAD I'M BUT IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT WOULD BE BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN
BI97DNYfe5I_5	AH I THINK THAT I MEAN I HAD FUN WITH IT SO
_dI--eQ6qVU_2	ANNE I LOVE IT
ob23OKe5a9Q_13	I HAVE YOUR ROOMS AND THAT'S IT
9qR7uwkblbs_30	ON THIS SPOILED SKINS RIGHT NOW I TOTALLY KNEW MATTIE AND NICK WERE GOING TO BE RELATED I THINK I KNEW IT LIKE I KNEW IT I
cXypl4FnoZo_27	I WAS SAYING IF SHE IS NOT TO MARRY HIM I WILL
nbWiPyCm4g0_1	AND LET ME TELL YOU IT SURPASSED ITSELF
atnd_PF-Lbs_6	I MIGHT HAVE TO WATCH THE FIRST TWO AGAIN OR MAYBE JUST THE FIRST ONE TO STABILIZE MY THOUGHTS ON THE SERIES
d6hH302o4v8_21	BUT WHEN I SAW WAS THIS TRULY BORING
c7UH_rxdZv4_8	HE UM HAD ALL THE CHARM OF THE NARCISSUS THE FAT BOY THE WHOLE FILM
tmZoasNr4rU_12	I JUST COULDN'T FIND IT FINALLY
X3j2zQgwYgE_1	THAT'S GREAT
8qrpnFRGt2A_9	MIGHT HAVE BEEN IT MIGHT HAVE MADE MORE SENSE
IumbAb8q2dM_7	I'M USUALLY I'M NOT REALLY A BIT TYPIFYING ALIEN CANAL FAN BUTT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_13	HE IS BRILLIANT THERE IS NOT A MOVIE THAT I SEE HIM IN THAT I DON'T END OF CRYING BECAUSE HE IS SO FANTASTIC AND HE JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART WHENEVER HE DOES YOU KNOW A ROLE THAT USUALLY HIS ROLES DO BREAK YOUR HEART IT'S SO DEFTLY DID IN THIS MOVIE
Bfr499ggo-0_20	THE WRITING IS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST
d3_k5Xpfmik_12	AND I HONESTLY THINK IF IF WE HADN'T HAVE SEEN WATCHMAN THIS WOULD BE THE BEST DAY'S QUINCES OF THE YEAR
I5y0__X72p0_24	NOT LIKE A REALLY GOOD TWIST
bOL9jKpeJRs_13	VERY HEARTENING VERY
bOL9jKpeJRs_32	THAT'S WHAT IT IS TO BE FOR ME AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS TO BE
c5xsKMxpXnc_11	AND YOU DON'T SEE WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER
MLal-t_vJPM_17	AND THE ONLY EXPLANATION COME UP WITH MAKES THIS STORY KIND OF KIND OF CREEPY BECAUSE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_24	HE DELIVERS A LOT OF INTENSITY
BioHAh1qJAQ_27	CLEW WHICH IS THE PROGRAMME THAT HE CREATED THE FIRST MOVIE KINDLE IT PULLS THE BUNNY ON THE BOILER MOMENT IN THE SENSE THAT HE TURNS INTO A CRAZY JEALOUS CYCLOS SACRAGE
c7UH_rxdZv4_6	FACT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS WAS ONE OF MOST OBNOXIOUS MAIN CHARACTERS I HAVE SEEN A LONG TIME
f_pcplsH_V0_6	IT'S BEN'S ROOM TOO
G-xst2euQUc_16	I'M NOT REALLY IN A BIG HURRY AT MY AGE DO YOU SEE ANIMATED MOVIES
tmZoasNr4rU_14	IT WAS JUST THERE I WASN'T I WASN'T AMUSED
BioHAh1qJAQ_15	ER THEY DON'T WASTE OUR TIME ON EXPOSITION BECAUSE
7JsX8y1ysxY_24	AND HE WAS ALSO
5W7Z1C_fDaE_20	EXTREMELY WELL MADE IT'S EXTREMELY
TvyZBvOMOTc_10	EVEN THOUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE IS FACED ON WHETHER SHE GETS DUBLIN IN TIME YOU'RE NEVER REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE GUESSED THAT
OtBXNcAL_lE_15	THE SAME IN RISE AND FALL
k5Y_838nuGo_2	AND IT DON'T SURPRISE ME
cW1FSBF59ik_24	FRED OAKES IS THE BLOB
jUzDDGyPkXU_16	IT KEEPS YOUR INTERESTS IN THE ACTION SCENES AT LEAST DURING THIS MOVING
9J25DZhivz8_8	SO I'D LIKED THAT A LOT
_dI--eQ6qVU_8	HE FUNNY'D UP THIS M Y BIG TIME TOTALLY
zhpQhgha_KU_22	AND MAY EVEN FEED ON THEIR KIDS BECAUSE
VbQk4H8hgr0_34	AND THERE IS AN INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CHARACTER OF DISINTEMPER'S CHARACTER ALREADY IN THE FILM
cW1FSBF59ik_23	I'M WELL I LOVE THE SCENES WHICH SEEMED TO THOSE WHO REIGNED AND TO THE TRUCKS THAT'S A GOOD JACK RABBIT I'M
vyB00TXsimI_20	AND I ENJOYED MYSELF A LOT AT THE MOVIE
ob23OKe5a9Q_6	I DON'T LIKE CHEESY JOKES AND JOKES AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF FUNNY THINGS ARE REALLY BAD
5W7Z1C_fDaE_9	IT'S A HUGE BREAK THROUGH FOR HEAVEN'S SMITH
OtBXNcAL_lE_3	AH I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY
G-xst2euQUc_21	RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE
tmZoasNr4rU_20	MAYBE IT COULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY SECONDS LONGER
VbQk4H8hgr0_52	THE RUBY DID HAVE SOME POINTS WHERE I WAS LAUGHING
lXPQBPVc5Cw_7	YOU KNOW IT'S TERRIBLE WHEN A PERSON TRYING TO REVIEW IT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY BUT I DON'T KNOW THIS MAY BE WORSE
VbQk4H8hgr0_12	OR ANYTHING ORIGINAL
ZUXBRvtny7o_27	COSSACK HAD A GOOD TURN
Oz06ZWiO20M_7	AND IT IS BAD
5W7Z1C_fDaE_24	ABSOLUTELY NOT TO BE MISSED
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_9	I THINK THE KEEPER REDEEMED THE MOVIE FOR BEING SO BAD IN THE DIALOGUE DEPARTMENT
jUzDDGyPkXU_14	THEY GIVE YOU A GOOD MANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE MONEY
d6hH302o4v8_15	THERE AIN'T GOIN AS WELL
8OtFthrtaJM_6	FIRST OFF THE COMMERCIAL MAKES THE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MISTAKE OF SAYING THAT IT IS MORE THE PROVOKING THAN INCEPTION
2iD-tVS8NPw_15	IT LOOKS LIKE A CARTOON
f9O3YtZ2VfI_12	ANOTHER THING IS WE DON'T NEED US ENTIRELY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_3	ALL OF YOU KNEW THAT OBVIOUSLY
Sqr0AcuoNnk_9	THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FUNNY
1iG0909rllw_21	THINK IT WAS EMPIRE MAGAZINE'S REVIEW OF NEW MOON THAT SAID THAT CHRISTIAN RELIED HEAVILY ON THE TACTIC OF A TACTIC OF BLINKING A LOT WHICH SHE REALLY DOES DO A LOT
W8NXH0Djyww_6	BUT IT WAS IT WAS
ob23OKe5a9Q_11	YOU YOU KNOW THE ACTORS OF THE GREAT JOHN BRINGS MERCEDES SUCH AS JOVE DORS LOPEZ HE OF PATRIMONY AND SO FORTH
phBUpBr1hSo_10	THIS REALLY SEEMED ON A LITTLE LONGER
Bfr499ggo-0_18	IF YOU'RE FAIR I'LL DO IT
7JsX8y1ysxY_34	AH BUT IT'S EXTREMELY DARK
BXuRRbG0Ugk_27	THEY'RE ALL PLAYING CLASHED STOCK WESTERN CHARACTERS BUT
POKffnXeBds_3	YES YOU'D HAVE THE FACTS IN TERMS OF WHITE GIRLS BUT WHEN HERS REALLY ISN'T THAT FAT
2WGyTLYerpo_60	AND TO GIVE IT AND EIGHT OUT OF TEN
QN9ZIUWUXsY_6	ARE THESE TWO THINGS POSSIBLE IN THE SAME SENTENCE I I REALLY DO THINK SO
tStelxIAHjw_15	KIND OF HAVE A M ARTISTIC RADIO UP ON THE MAIN CHANNEL
nzpVDcQ0ywM_14	HE DOES SOME STEREOTYPICAL THINGS LIKE OUR TALKING ABOUT BUSTING A CAP WHILE FLYING AN AEROPLANE
73jzhE8R1TQ_3	LEAVE IT BECAUSE NEVER FOR IT WAS NOT MINE I'LL TAKE A BOOK
bOL9jKpeJRs_5	REAL IS REALLY JUST THE HEART OF A MAN'S STORY
VbQk4H8hgr0_21	IT DISAPPOINTED ME HIGHLY AND
2iD-tVS8NPw_10	AND I JUST HAD FUN WATCHING THIS LOUISE
atnd_PF-Lbs_5	I HATE IT
bOL9jKpeJRs_19	I REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ARE SIXTY SIX AND THAT'S MY BOY
WKA5OygbEKI_1	AH I REALLY ENJOYED DOING THEM FOR THE PHILLIPS MAY BE CLUBS SO I THOUGHT
2iD-tVS8NPw_12	VERY MUCH OF A LIGHT HEARTED
LSi-o-IrDMs_5	IN THIS CASE IT DIDN'T TAKE MUCH CONVINCING WHICH WAS A LITTLE SILLY BUT
tStelxIAHjw_16	I LOVE YOU GUY'S
2WGyTLYerpo_41	HE GETS DEVELOPED MORE AND MORE LIKEABLE CHARACTERS
VbQk4H8hgr0_26	YOU'RE HOPING TO IF YOU HAVE TO THE HALF KIDS AND YOU'RE FORCED TO GO WHICH PROBABLY WILL IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU KNOW PUT UP WITH IT AS A PARENT BUT
OtBXNcAL_lE_16	BUT SHE'S IN TROUBLE YOU KNOW SHE WAS ONLY TO TELL HER BEST FRIEND MOTHER
9T9Hf74oK10_12	BUT REGARDLESS I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY GOOD MOVING
ob23OKe5a9Q_7	WELL IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN YOU SHOULD SEE THIS MILLY IF YOU REALLY LIKE CHESSY JOKES BUT THE OTHER NIGHT IT WAS A PERFECT THEORY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_19	THE IRON MAN FILMS ARE FONDLY REMEMBERED MOSTLY FOR ROBERT DOWNY JUNIOR NOT THE ACTION
9T9Hf74oK10_15	AND HERE NIGHTLY I MEAN EVERYBODY KNOWS OR FROM PARTS OF THE CARIBBEAN BUT
OtBXNcAL_lE_22	I WAS NOT REALLY BORED WITH IT
73jzhE8R1TQ_8	IT DID A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THE BACK STORY IN THE BOOK
8OtFthrtaJM_17	ALWAYS IT WAS FUNNY AT TIMES
I5y0__X72p0_16	ITS NOT GRAD IT IT
d6hH302o4v8_8	VERY BORING
f9O3YtZ2VfI_10	THE MOVE IS TOO LONG AND
bvLlb-M3UXU_15	HE'S IN TERRIFIC SHAPE FOR A MAN TWICE MY AGE WHO LOOKS EVIDENTLY BETTER THAN ME THAT'S
WKA5OygbEKI_19	IF YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY SMALL FRIENDS OF THAT SOUNDED REALLY PERVERTED SMALL CHILDREN THAT YOU ARE RELATED TO AH TO TAKE TO THE MOVIES I WOULDN'T GO SEE IT BY MYSELF
1iG0909rllw_8	I THOUGHT THAT WAS AWFUL
1iG0909rllw_22	BUT THEN THE SAME GOES FOR A PERSON AS EDWARD'S AND TAKEN THEIR LOOK NOW AS JACOB THEY DON'T LIKE FROWNING I AM A MANLY MAN AND I FROWNED
BvYR0L6f2Ig_1	AND I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS WORK ON THE FIRST ONE
Jkswaaud0hk_19	I GO SEE IT
bvLlb-M3UXU_3	LITTLE TO NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT ALL MOVIE
8OtFthrtaJM_15	INTERESTINGLY IT TURNED OUT TO BE MORE OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY THAN IT WAS A THRILLER
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_1	AND IT STARTS OUT REALLY SLOW
5W7Z1C_fDaE_11	JOHN GUDEMAN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING MLISS
aiEXnCPZubE_4	QUITE FRANKLY SHE IS PLAUSIBLE
wMbj6ajWbic_20	AH AND NOW THE PERFORMANCES ARE LIKE SOMETHING LIKE TO WRITE HOME ABOUT
1iG0909rllw_18	YOU MEAN I AM EVEN WITH A BIGGER BETTER BUDGETS IT WAS STILL TOO LONG
Jkswaaud0hk_3	THERE'S SOME GREAT BEDROOM SCENES
VCslbP0mgZI_12	SO O K IF I WERE A WOMAN I WOULD SAY O K SHE'S MAKING A COMMENT ABOUT THE WAY WOMEN CAN'T BE A POWER IN MALE DOMINATE SOCIETIES AND THE WAY MEN ARE DISTRACTED AND HURT AND DAMAGE WOMEN AND PREVENT THEM FROM ASSERTING WHO THEY REALLY ARE
zhpQhgha_KU_27	SOME OF THE VERY RELATE OF IT
IumbAb8q2dM_17	REALLY EXCITED
v0zCBqDeKcE_3	NOW I HAD NO IDEA HOW BAD THIS MOVING WAS GOING TO BE
_dI--eQ6qVU_22	I JUST REALLY ENJOYED IT
73jzhE8R1TQ_12	IT ISN'T REALLY A BIG GALE THOUGHT I I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT JOHN HAD AN I PHONE BECAUSE
Oz06ZWiO20M_1	WAS PRETTY FUNNY AND AS STUPID FOR MOVIES HAVE THIS REALLY LONG LIKE REALLY NUMBER LONG BUT LIKE REALLY INTENSE RANT ABOUT IT I'M A
LSi-o-IrDMs_16	IT'S GOOD TO SIT RIGHT IN THE LITTLE THEATRE WITH THREE AND THE
9J25DZhivz8_9	THE VOICE ACTING IN THIS WAS INCREDIBLE
cM3Yna7AavY_10	PERSONALLY I LIKED ATLANTIS
8OtFthrtaJM_11	I WAS JUST WAITING FOR JOSEPH GORDON LEVIN TO COME OUT JUST JUMP OUT AT ANY TIME AND SAY IT'S A PARADOX
f_pcplsH_V0_15	I'LL JUST CATALOGUE NOW THIS IS GOING TOO FAR
5W7Z1C_fDaE_17	AH IT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE FORMS OF KNOCK AND IT BE EASY FOR YOU TO FIND IT
wMbj6ajWbic_24	MY WAITIN'S A LOT OF FUN
wMbj6ajWbic_21	I'M THAT'S BEING SAID EVEN SO THAT MY PEOPLE WERE HAVING THE FUN OF THIS
MLal-t_vJPM_1	I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THREE D IS REALLY RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE
W8NXH0Djyww_7	IT'S A GREAT MOVIE
BioHAh1qJAQ_14	ESPECIALLY FACTS OR AMAZING
BI97DNYfe5I_17	THE ACTION WAS GOOD
Njd1F0vZSm4_7	BUT THE STORY IS VERY DARK
lXPQBPVc5Cw_14	BUT THE THE ACTUAL STORY LINE WAS JUST TERRIBLE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_9	I GAVE IT A BEE
phBUpBr1hSo_19	BOB PRETTY HAD SCRIPTUR
Clx4VXItLTE_6	AND THE ONLY PHILAMMON REALLY SCARED ABOUT IS SMALL SOLDIERS
v0zCBqDeKcE_16	MISSUS CAP
TvyZBvOMOTc_15	ALL IN ALL IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A CUTE ROMANTIC COMEDY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SETTING THEN THIS WILL PROBABLY BE THE GOOD THING FOR YOU
c7UH_rxdZv4_2	REALLY BAD MOODY
2iD-tVS8NPw_11	NOT LIKE A DARK MOVING OR ANYTHING
k5Y_838nuGo_29	I DON'T THINK I KNEW THE PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING ABOUT IT
aiEXnCPZubE_17	HER CHARACTER IS ALSO UNDEVELOPED AND WEAK
8d-gEyoeBzc_25	PREDATORY IS REALLY WELL PACED MOVING AND
0h-zjBukYpk_1	NOW AT THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE SHE SAYS IT ALL
I5y0__X72p0_4	SO I SAW SOME OTHER REVIEWS AND I WAS LIKE FOUQUET I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE
6Egk_28TtTM_5	AND MY FAVORITE PART IN THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MY LITTLE HALF TO SAVE GRIBBLE
BI97DNYfe5I_2	AH I WAS EXPECTING SETH ROGAN TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS IN THIS MOVIE BUT HE WASN'T
G6GlGvlkxAQ_3	I THINK THAT WOULD DO VERY WELL
MLal-t_vJPM_4	IF YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER SEEING IT ANYWAY
8qrpnFRGt2A_12	EH I DON'T NEED AT THREE HOURS OF THE EPOCH ABOUT YOU
wMbj6ajWbic_10	IS THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IN HIS COURIERS
2WGyTLYerpo_11	ACTION IS REALLY INTENSE WHICH SURPRISED ME
Ci-AH39fi3Y_15	BUT I TOTALLY MISSED HOW IT TIED INTO THE MOVING AT ALL
vyB00TXsimI_4	SHE ALSO HAS PRETTY SWEET MOVES
Vj1wYRQjB-o_5	WHO WANTED YOU SIR
ZAIRrfG22O0_8	AND YOU PUT OFF SAVING YOUR MONEY AH IT MAY BE RENTING IT WHEN IT COMES OUT ON AN AVIDIOSO
Iu2PFX3z_1s_13	IN YOUR FACE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_5	IT HAPPENED AND ONE TWO AND THREE ARE WIPED AWAY
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_15	AND IT REALLY JUST LACKED WHAT MADE THE MOVIES MORE ENJOYABLE
tIrG4oNLFzE_16	HOW CAN YOU GO INTO A FILM INTO A LEADING ROLE AND HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOUR CHARACTER IS
03bSnISJMiM_9	AND WHAT'S YOURS
wMbj6ajWbic_9	AND THE SCRIPT IS QUARRIED I
1iG0909rllw_16	I MEAN THE ENTIRE TWO THIRDS THAT IS A BALLAST JUAN CHRISTENSEN'S SHIP'S CHARACTER MOPING AROUND COMPLETELY DEPRESSED
c7UH_rxdZv4_11	GARB THE STOCANICS
Jkswaaud0hk_9	GREAT STEAMY BELGIAN SCENES AND
8qrpnFRGt2A_15	AND THE LAST BIG THING WAS JUST A DON'T IT I KNOW IT'S ABOUT GEE I JOE AND NOVICES CAN BE BUT THE ARMY BUT IT JUST FELT LIKE A GUN LIKE A MILITARY PROPAGANDA KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW
OtBXNcAL_lE_14	IT'S PREDICABLE
c7UH_rxdZv4_20	AND THEN CAME DIAZ WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE PLUCKY I GUESS SHE'S KIND OF USELESS
0h-zjBukYpk_11	HE'S THE START OF THE MOVING
IumbAb8q2dM_18	I I AS FOR ALEX HEFFER I AM A NEW ALEX PETTIFER
1DmNV9C1hbY_14	I DIDN'T CARE FOR IT
ZUXBRvtny7o_9	I'M AND HE WISHED THE MUSIC IS GOOD
nzpVDcQ0ywM_1	EYES AND HE REALLY SEEMS TO BE CHANNELING MICHAEL BAY IN THIS MOVIE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_8	JOHNNIE DAB DURING THE VOICE WAS FANTASTIC
bvLlb-M3UXU_12	COME THROUGH ON THAT
LSi-o-IrDMs_7	THE PLOT IS IN A WHAT
cXypl4FnoZo_23	IT WOULD MAKE SENSE
rnaNMUZpvvg_16	BUT HERE'S OURSELVES COMPLETELY REDUCED BY AGES
2iD-tVS8NPw_25	WHAT WHAT WON'T YOU DO FOR A GREENLAND TO RUBY TOO THAT WOULD BE EVEN LIKE WORTH WHILE NOW IT IS
BI97DNYfe5I_9	I STILL HAD FUN WITH IT
8qrpnFRGt2A_2	JUST WANTED SOMETHING TO WATCH MYLES FALL ASLEEP
VbQk4H8hgr0_48	I LOVED IT AND THIS ONE JUST WAS A FLAT OFF HIS MIND AND SO
atnd_PF-Lbs_8	YOU CAN IMAGINE MY EXCITEMENT WHEN I HEARD THIS WAS BEING RELEASED
Sqr0AcuoNnk_22	BUT LIKE THIS KIND OF DEPRESSION
Bfr499ggo-0_15	I DON'T CALL THAT NECESSARY
1iG0909rllw_4	AHEM I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT HAD ITS FLAWS
Sqr0AcuoNnk_2	I THERE WERE TIMES IN THE MOVING WHERE I FELT REALLY BORED
8OtFthrtaJM_14	NOW I'M NOT I'M NOT EXCITED ANY MORE
Oz06ZWiO20M_18	FERNY DIAL ON ME
7JsX8y1ysxY_31	I WAS VERY IMPRESSED
jUzDDGyPkXU_9	THE ALIENS ARE REALLY OXEN THEY
VCslbP0mgZI_10	IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY OF HER INFECTED THE RACES
8d-gEyoeBzc_5	I'M I'M ALREADY POINTING OUT WHY I DON'T THINK YOU'RE REALLY POOR HE PULLED ALF
iiK8YX8oH1E_12	DO FOR GOODWIN IS FINE TO WATCH
03bSnISJMiM_8	AND THERE'S LIFE THERE'S A LITTLE SOMEWHAT IT WASN'T A LOT ABOUT SOMETHING
LSi-o-IrDMs_10	THE AMENDMENT IS NIL
wMbj6ajWbic_15	I DID LIKE TRANSFORMS TO YOU NOAH YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT
PZ-lDQFboO8_8	AH YOU KNOW ALONG WITH THE ZOBAN I WOULD PROBABLY SAY GO SEE THIS MOVING AT AN EARLY SHOWING DON'T SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE NIGHT YOU MEAN
73jzhE8R1TQ_4	IT WAS A GOOD FIGHT
d6hH302o4v8_4	AND IT'S GETTING VERY TIRING HE'S
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_1	OF ROBIN HOOD'S STARTING RUSSELL CROW AH FIRST THING I COULD SAY ABOUT THE BAT I WAS DREADING GOING IN TO SEE THIS MOVIE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_3	DO YOU THINK IT'S A VERY INTERESTING ONE
fvVhgmXxadc_12	WHAT'S IN HER MIND WITHIN HER MIND IN A WAY IT'S KIND OF A CONCEPTION IN THAT WAY
G6GlGvlkxAQ_6	I'M GREATLY IN HIS MOVEMENTS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT
2WGyTLYerpo_53	I WAS IN A HUGE FAN OF IT
Oz06ZWiO20M_22	THIS MOVIE IS REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE THE PLOT IS WHAT LITTLE THERE IS
iiK8YX8oH1E_9	I THINK WITH THESE TERMS WE CANNOT PREDICT IN THE
ZUXBRvtny7o_30	THAT THING THIS IS NORMAL IS NOT BAD IT IS NOT BAD AT ALL
BI97DNYfe5I_18	COME I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOUGOSA AND THEATRES
f_pcplsH_V0_13	THEY DON'T MOVE YOU DON'T SEE IT BUT
BioHAh1qJAQ_21	THIS CONNECTION THAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT BECAUSE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_12	ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ROMANTIC DRAMAS LIKE IT'S A IT GETS THE AUDIENCES TO THEATRES BECAUSE IT'S A COMPELLING IDEA BUT IT'S BEEN A
_dI--eQ6qVU_13	AND THE ACTION SEQUENCES IN THIS MOVING ARE INTENSE I
cM3Yna7AavY_8	THEY AREN'T DOING SO BROTHER THERE
Oz06ZWiO20M_16	A MOMENT'S NARRATIVE FILM IS ABOUT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND PLOT AND THEN SPECTACLE LIKE IN THIRD PLACE
Clx4VXItLTE_7	I GUESS THAT'S FREAKY AS HELL EH M WHAT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_18	A MY FRIEND NEXT TO ME FELL ASLEEP AND
nzpVDcQ0ywM_22	A STORM SHADOW IS VERY COOL
9T9Hf74oK10_19	BUT ALWAYS THEY DID AH THEY DID ACT VERY WELL
7JsX8y1ysxY_2	I'M SOME REALLY GOOD I THINK
0h-zjBukYpk_17	AND HE ALMOST LOOKED EXACTLY THE SAME AS HIS CHARACTER IN DEFIANCE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_19	IT IS WEIRD
2WGyTLYerpo_52	I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING THAT
Nzq88NnDkEk_26	AND ON THIS MOVEY DON'T GO SEE IT GO SEE SOMETHING ELSE HOW TO TRAIN AND DRAG IT AND DOWN THAT'S ALL WE SAY BUT THAT'S SO
8qrpnFRGt2A_5	BECAUSE I AM THREE MAJOR COMPLAINTS I HAVE ABOUT THIS MOVIE
Clx4VXItLTE_29	FROM THERE IT DOES GET A BIT LIKE NOT AS REAL AS WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON
W8NXH0Djyww_17	AH LIKE THIS RUBY HAD GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES
BvYR0L6f2Ig_21	I'VE NOT SEEN ONE BAD MOODY THAT SHE'S AN INSTANT
2WGyTLYerpo_18	ALIENS ARE REALLY COOL
iiK8YX8oH1E_18	SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY REALISTIC CHARACTER HERE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_4	AND SO ALWAYS THE FIRST ONE WAS BETTER
bOL9jKpeJRs_23	AND HE'S A MESS AND A MESS OF EMOTIONS AND A MESS OF NERVES
BI97DNYfe5I_14	PLAYED CATO PERFECTLY AND
2iD-tVS8NPw_4	A HUGE SPECTACLE MOVING THAT IS GREAT FOR THE SUMMER TIME IN THE
bOL9jKpeJRs_16	I AM I THINK I FAVOURED HER IN A TIME WHEN YOU WERE LYING OUT OF IT AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE HAD HOW MUCH
_dI--eQ6qVU_21	IT ENGAGES THE EYE ONCE MORE
9J25DZhivz8_7	STORY HAD ELEMENTS OF IT BUT THIS MAY BE PLAYED WITH THREE D AND A DIFFERENT WASTE COME AT YOU OUT OF THE SCREEN
bOL9jKpeJRs_8	IT'S THE SAME KIND OF A VIOLIN NOT ENOUGH SAID HAMPERING FIVE YEAR OLD
Ci-AH39fi3Y_29	THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE ENDING WASN'T GOOD BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_14	AND THE DIALOGUE THEIR MOUTHS OF THE
f_pcplsH_V0_12	I'M SURE YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE STAFF MOVIES THAT WHERE THEY FOUND THE SCREEN MOVINGS BUT THERE'S THE SYDNEY AND UNIVERSE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD COMMENT ON THE KILLERS REACTING THE MOVIES OR FOLLOWING UP THE MOVIES WELL IN THE FIRST HOUR IT GOES TO COME AWAY WELL WELL TOO MUCH OF THE PLOT'S LIKELY
8qrpnFRGt2A_7	AND AH THE STORY WAS PRETTY WEIRD
cXypl4FnoZo_12	I'M I THINK I'LL SEE IT CAUSE I I ENJOYED IT NOW I'M
v0zCBqDeKcE_2	ALTHOUGH BROCK DID A UNIQUE MOVIE LAST TUESDAY
03bSnISJMiM_7	WELL SINCE I'VE GOT YOU YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
Ci-AH39fi3Y_30	BUT IT WAS NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING AND SERIOUSLY EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO THE END WAS BETTER THAN THE END IN WHICH
d6hH302o4v8_17	MADE NO SENSE OF IT
iiK8YX8oH1E_7	MOSTLY IT'S JUST KATE HUDSON BEING VERY ANNOYING
I5y0__X72p0_34	I WASN'T BAD
5W7Z1C_fDaE_22	DARE I SAY FUN TO WATCH IN A REALLY MESSED UP KIND OF WAY AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S A HORRIFYMENT
W8NXH0Djyww_3	I WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE
LSi-o-IrDMs_2	THE MOVIE ITSELF IS THE SAME OLD PRODUCT FROM THE SERIES
G6GlGvlkxAQ_15	THEY NEEDED THE CHARACTER ESTABLISHMENT RIGHT AWAY
OQvJTdtJ2H4_12	SO IT IS NOT A LIE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_1	I CAN'T EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THIS MOVE ADEQUATELY WITHOUT DESCRIBING SPECIFIC THINGS IN THE THIRD ACT OF THE MOVIE WHICH
I5y0__X72p0_32	OF THE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_3	I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT AH HOW IT'S THE PERFORMANCES IN IT WERE SORT OF OVERLOOKED AT THE ACADEMY OF WARDS BECAUSE
OtBXNcAL_lE_18	LAMORA
I5y0__X72p0_11	IT WAS IT WAS AND IT WAS THE OUTCOME OF A BASICALLY
9qR7uwkblbs_4	ONLY THE MOODY WAS REALLY POKING ALSO
vvZ4IcEtiZc_6	SOME OF THE GREAT PERFORMANCES OF LAST YEAR WERE A KIND OF OVERLOOK AS THERE WERE JUST SO MANY OF THEM
9c67fiY0wGQ_4	I ALSO LIKE HOW THE STORY LINE OF THEM WILL BE WORKED TOGETHER SMOOTHLY
vyB00TXsimI_7	ALSO TO A LORD OF THE RING'S GROUNDS WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE
tIrG4oNLFzE_6	AS IF THE SPARKS IN IT MUST BE DEAD
1iG0909rllw_15	THE BOOK ISN'T NECESSARILY THE MOST THRILLING BOOK EVER
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_12	THERE WAS A CABIN COST IN A PRINCE OF FEE'S VERSION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DARK AND EDGEY VERSION OF ITS TIME BUT MEAN THAT WAS WHAT THIRTEEN YEARS AGO FOURTEEN YEARS AGO PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_19	BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO ARE IN THEIR MIDDAY OR MID THIRTIES AT THE OLDEST AND THEY'RE LOOKING PRETTY ROUGH IN THIS MOVIE LIKE
bOL9jKpeJRs_29	N HEN HEN
lXPQBPVc5Cw_6	I'M BUT THIS ONE WAS AH I DON'T KNOW I MEAN THE STORY WAS THERE BUT I DON'T KNOW
HEsqda8_d0Q_16	VOICES WERE REALLY GOOD THERE
IumbAb8q2dM_21	EYES OH I THINK IT'S BEEN A FAVOUR
nzpVDcQ0ywM_4	ALL IN ALL IT'S KIND OF A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ANY OF US WHO GREW UP IN THE EIGHTIES AND ARE USED TO THE TOYS IN THE CARTOON
cW1FSBF59ik_22	ALTHOUGH I DO AGREE THAT THE LOOK COULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO FIT THE ACTUAL SHAPES WITH THE RIGHT HAIR
IumbAb8q2dM_6	IT SURPASSED MY EXPECTATIONS
zhpQhgha_KU_1	I'LL FINISH OFF BY SAYING THAT I REALLY WASN'T VERY IMPRESSED WITH LILY
cXypl4FnoZo_26	WAS NICER THAN PETER
W8NXH0Djyww_25	FOR SOME IT WAS JUST IT WAS FUN IT WAS A FUN ENTERTAINING MOVIE
Nzq88NnDkEk_4	THE LITTLE HUSBAND AT FIRST THE EYES YOU ARE WITH WITH MY BOOTS
d3_k5Xpfmik_15	THE SEQUENCES OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM WHICH FEATURE COLUMBUS EXPLAINS IN SOME OF HIS HEIR RULES TO SURVIVING A ZAND THE APOCALYPSE ARE REALLY WELL DONE
zhpQhgha_KU_17	TO THINK THAT I REALLY LIKED THE MIRANDA'S CHARACTERS
Nzq88NnDkEk_28	DID NOT WANT TO GIVE THIS MOVING IN THE MANNER OF YOU I
BioHAh1qJAQ_26	WHEN THE OLD THING FINDS THESE THINGS WHATEVER THEY ARE THEY ARE SO WISE AND NAIVE KINDLY LIKE NOBBY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT
etzxEpPuc6I_4	THE THING ABOUT THIS ONLY IS LIKE OF A ONE COMPARED TO TRANSFORM AS TO AND ACTUALLY DID
G6GlGvlkxAQ_18	ALL WILDLY SHOWING THE HUMORS
MLal-t_vJPM_3	YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR KIDS
8d-gEyoeBzc_6	AND WHY IT WAS A MISTAKE REALLY TO TRY AND DO THAT
Bfr499ggo-0_16	BUT THE LOT OF THE MOMENT WAS CHARLOTTE IN THE CLOSET BECAUSE WHO HASN'T EXPERIENCED THAT
BI97DNYfe5I_3	HE WASN'T HE WAS THE SAME OLD GUY SETH ROAN THAT WE ALL KNOW
ZUXBRvtny7o_29	BUNNY WAS REALLY GOOD
8d-gEyoeBzc_19	AND HER THE GRAND DEFERRER WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER
BioHAh1qJAQ_4	EVERYTHING AND NOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT ACTUALLY DOLLY'S ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING
5W7Z1C_fDaE_2	AH IT'S REALLY THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS FILM IT'S BIG
pLTX3ipuDJI_16	IN FINALE I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVE FOR RENTAL NOT IN THE THEATER BECAUSE IT'S A LOW GRADE OF THE EIGHTY SEVEN VERSION AND ONLY IF YOU LIKE THE SERIES
iiK8YX8oH1E_14	LIKE A SAID KATE HUDSON COULDN'T BE MORE ANNOYING HERE
BI97DNYfe5I_31	TWO PRETTY TENTS AT THE END
2WGyTLYerpo_30	AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT MAN
v0zCBqDeKcE_5	IT'S SUCH A REAL GOOD COMEDY
yDtzw_Y-7RU_14	AND THIS FILM IS THIS AMAZING BECAUSE A SLAVISH DEVOTION CHASTE ENDS WITH AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE
8qrpnFRGt2A_11	WHICH I MEAN FOR I'M MOODY ABOUT IT GEE I JOE NINETY MINUTES IS ENOUGH
aiEXnCPZubE_16	AND WAS IS RIDICULOUS AND
ZUXBRvtny7o_28	AND I THIS MARIE I WAS NOTHING FOR TO SEE THIS MARIE
TvyZBvOMOTc_3	THE COUNTRYSIDE WHICH THEY SHOWED WHILE GOING ACROSS IRELAND WAS ASTOUNDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
Af8D0E4ZXaw_10	AND SECONDLY BECAUSE AS A MARVELLOUS GEEK I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY FAIR SHARE OF DISAPPOINTMENTS OVER THE LAST DECADE AND I CAN GENUINELY SIPP
8d-gEyoeBzc_4	AS THAT YOU KNOW HIS ALIENS WAS TOO ALIEN
zhpQhgha_KU_9	I DON'T KNOW THAT SHE THOUGHT I WAS REALLY REALLY SAD
X3j2zQgwYgE_3	COME IF YOU'RE NOT THERE
6Egk_28TtTM_3	I LIKED GRIBBLE BECAUSE HE HELPED MY LORD GET MY LORD'S MOTHER AWAY FROM THE ALIENS WHICH I
Nzq88NnDkEk_21	I MUST SAY THIS ONE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE WAITING UNTIL IT COMES DOWN ON EACH
_dI--eQ6qVU_18	AND ADD SOMETHING LIKE AN EXTRA SPARK IN THERE
bOL9jKpeJRs_27	A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT AND I'LL COME OUT SUCH A LONG TIME
2WGyTLYerpo_50	THEY ARE NOTICEABLE FLAWS
d6hH302o4v8_20	THE TRAIL WORKED LIKE A COVEY OF LITTLE GOOD
f9O3YtZ2VfI_17	I AIN'T GOING TO DO MOSTLY SEEDY I JUST MAKE AN ANIMATED MOVIE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_30	AH JESUS I DON'T KNOW IT WAS IT'S SAD THOUGH BECAUSE I EXPECTED SO MUCH MORE
Bfr499ggo-0_4	JUST GO IN WITH NO EXIT
7JsX8y1ysxY_37	IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS SORT OF OVERWHELMINGLY BAD
7JsX8y1ysxY_28	VERY DARK
2WGyTLYerpo_59	I REALLY ENJOYED COWBOYS AND ALIENS I'M
yDtzw_Y-7RU_6	BECAUSE THIS I HAVE FOUND THE BASELY SAYS YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD DO TO TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE JESUS TOLD US TO TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE AND IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO BURN IN HELL
vyB00TXsimI_13	SHE IS A REALLY PRETTY GIRL
c7UH_rxdZv4_28	HE WAS THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT WAS SLIGHTLY INTERESTING
GWuJjcEuzt8_8	FEEL LIKE HE'S GOING TO FALL A PIE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_15	HE'S PRETTY AVERAGE TOO
cW1FSBF59ik_17	HE WAS LOOKING AT IT
wMbj6ajWbic_29	THERE'S A BRIDGE OUT OF THE SNAKE AS IT'S ALWAYS CALLED TO SEE THAT
WKA5OygbEKI_21	BUT AH IT WAS WORTH THE FRIENDLY PASSES THAT HE USED ON IT
wMbj6ajWbic_23	I THINK I'M RACHEL NICKLES HELD OUT A SORT OF A ROW
iiK8YX8oH1E_4	IF YOU CAN TOLERATE HER THE REST OF THE MOVIE ISN'T ANY BETTER
c7UH_rxdZv4_17	JUST LIKE WHAT HE CAN DO HE CAN DO LOTS OF STUFF SAID FRED
bOL9jKpeJRs_6	GREATLY IS HE OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOUR WHOLE FAMILY CONCEDED
cW1FSBF59ik_20	BUT IN THIS OH MY GOD I LOVE YOU
5W7Z1C_fDaE_19	BUT WHENEVER IT COMES TO YOUR TOWN DO NOT MISS IT
G-xst2euQUc_9	I I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE WAS REALLY CUTE
LSi-o-IrDMs_1	IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE
wMbj6ajWbic_4	BIG ON IT UM
vvZ4IcEtiZc_11	BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S AN AUDIENCE PLEASE OR YOU KNOW
6Egk_28TtTM_7	BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD MOVIE
9c67fiY0wGQ_11	AND THE CHILDREN ALL LIKED THE MOVIE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_17	A WISE PERSON WEARING TIGHTS
zhpQhgha_KU_32	I'M WELL I'M IN IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT ANYHOW I'LL TELL YOU WHO ENJOYED THE FILM
2WGyTLYerpo_4	RESPECTING SOME ARTS THE SERIOUS OSCAR CONTENDED THEN YOU'RE WRONG
2WGyTLYerpo_23	I DON'T EXPECT THAT
5W7Z1C_fDaE_13	IT'S SO WELL DONE
k5Y_838nuGo_15	BECAUSE THE FIRST TWO WERE GREAT AND THEY BROUGHT IN THE KIDS AND IT MADE IT MORE KATY FRIENDLY RUBY
8d-gEyoeBzc_23	I THINK RODRIGUEZ WHEN HE WROTE THE NOTE WROTE THE MOVIE WAS GOING FOR A MILE AND BRENDA APOCALYPSE NOW TYPE OF CHARACTER BY A
I5y0__X72p0_29	IT VISUALIZES CONICALLY HOW THEY SHOW HER CONFUSION BECAUSE SHE GROWS UP IN THE WOODS
etzxEpPuc6I_9	AS WE SAY I KNOW IT WAS IT WAS JUST LIKE IT ISN'T THE PLOT THAT DOES THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_20	BUT DON'T YOU BE WRONG IT'S NOT ALL BAD
Clx4VXItLTE_8	INSIDIOUS M STARR REALLY GOOD
tIrG4oNLFzE_2	THE NOTE BOOK IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS
1iG0909rllw_24	AN YOU KNEW YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN LAUGHING
etzxEpPuc6I_5	HE'S LIKE THE OTHER BOTH HAS THEIR TOYS OR BOTH WILL BE BETTER MADE FOR CHILDREN BUT
Bfr499ggo-0_2	IT'S REALLY I
9qR7uwkblbs_19	YOU BOTH LIKE FLOGED AND SHEEDED
9J25DZhivz8_20	I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COOL
tStelxIAHjw_4	I THINK I'M GETTING TO THAT POINT WHERE I'M JUST NOT ENTERTAINED BY DIZZY PIGS ANY MORE BECAUSE I COULDN'T STAND UP
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_8	THAT MADE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE LOWERED BECAUSE OF ALWAYS REVIEWS BUT I REALLY DIDN'T HATE IT
2WGyTLYerpo_57	BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST FEARS ENTIRELY EXTINCTION MOVED CAREFULLY AGAIN
ZUXBRvtny7o_2	I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MOODY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_7	EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
BioHAh1qJAQ_17	AND THEN TELL THE GAMES LOOK GREAT
VbQk4H8hgr0_24	AND IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME
Jkswaaud0hk_2	GORGEOUS
d6hH302o4v8_13	BUT THIS REALLY HE WASN'T GOOD AT ALL
c5xsKMxpXnc_10	AND IT IS VERY RUSHED
Ci-AH39fi3Y_24	BUT THE END WAS REALLY IN ALL THAT
1DmNV9C1hbY_11	BUT FOR ME I WAS A LITTLE BOY
k5Y_838nuGo_23	HE IS A CASE MERELY
9qR7uwkblbs_18	AND YET I KNOW WE BOTH HAVE THAT AND LIKE AN EASY GAME
Qr1Ca94K55A_3	REALLY GOING ONLY FOR ME
etzxEpPuc6I_10	THE PLOT IS RIDICULOUS BUT NO ONE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY LIKE
8OtFthrtaJM_4	I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE
d6hH302o4v8_39	SEASON OF THE WITCH WAS HORRIBLE ACTING
lXPQBPVc5Cw_29	THE ADULTS WERE THE ADULTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO WATCH IT AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MY AGE AS WELL WERE LIKE WHAT DID I JUST SEE
f_pcplsH_V0_10	I LIKE THIS ONE GOOD BEATS FOR HIM TOO WELL
6Egk_28TtTM_4	AS I WAS ALSO
Nzq88NnDkEk_30	AND DOWN I GOT I GOT TO DO MY DUTY AND DON'T LET YOU GET TO KNOW IT'S A MAJOR FIST
Nzq88NnDkEk_20	MY FRIENDS WHO WERE THERE HAD NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT IT SO AT FIRST THE
rnaNMUZpvvg_18	IT'S SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE OH HE'S SO COOL WE SO AUSTIN LIKE YOU NEVER SEE THAT IN A MOVIE THIS PERSON WHO HASN'T MEASURED JUST KILLS ANYBODY EVEN I'M SLIGHT BUT THAT WAS SO UNNECESSARY WHY
cXypl4FnoZo_22	LIKE WE WANTED TO BE THAT SHE KNEW AH I MEAN TO SAY FORD'S CHARACTER KNEW IT WAS PETER BUT WAS PRETENDING SHE DIDN'T SO THAT SHE HAD A REASON TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM AND THEY COULD BE TOGETHER THAT'S
bOL9jKpeJRs_28	THERE'S A LOT OF FUSS ABOUT IT LATELY AND YOU KNOW WHAT A CONTROVERSY OF IT
vyB00TXsimI_19	I THOUGHT IT WAS FINE
9qR7uwkblbs_8	LASTLY THE BEST PART OF OUDY IM
9J25DZhivz8_10	STEVE CORREL VOICES GREW AND RUSSELL BRAND ACTUALLY REALLY IMPRESSED ME WITH HIS OLD MAN'S VOICE FOR THE DOCTOR
cW1FSBF59ik_6	I HOPE IT SHOWS
OtBXNcAL_lE_17	AND SO SHE'S ALL SAD WALKING IN THE RAIN BELOVED OF HER
VbQk4H8hgr0_38	I MEAN THE PLACE TO THE STORY
1iG0909rllw_2	WE LET SPACE AT THEIR ROOMS AND MASTER PIECES
bOL9jKpeJRs_14	I DREAMED
c5xsKMxpXnc_3	THEY'VE TALKED FOR WHAT FIVE MINUTES THEY INSTANTLY KISSED WHICH IS DUMB
8d-gEyoeBzc_14	SO WHEN YOU CARED ABOUT
BioHAh1qJAQ_6	UNFORTUNATELY N THE WRITERS AND I WERE NOT EXACTLY ON THE SAME LEVEL
BvYR0L6f2Ig_25	YOU ARE TO FEEL FOR HER CHARACTER
k5Y_838nuGo_19	WOULD GO OVER THE CONTENTS AND THIS IS WHAT THE FIRST ONE CAN'T ASK
atnd_PF-Lbs_4	SO NO NOW NO THIS I AM NOT A FAN OF THE FINAL DESTINATION SERIES
OQvJTdtJ2H4_5	FOR SOME OF MERCEDES
HEsqda8_d0Q_3	AND I ACTUALLY LIKES THE FILM A LOT AND I'LL
BXuRRbG0Ugk_13	BUT IF THAT'S ALL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOU'LL ACTUALLY MISS THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS MOVING
VbQk4H8hgr0_15	I LOVED THE SIMPLETONS
c7UH_rxdZv4_24	HE WAS STILL BORING
8qrpnFRGt2A_21	IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A LIVE ACTION MOVING YOU'RE GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED
2WGyTLYerpo_25	REALLY ENJOYED THAT
X3j2zQgwYgE_6	TO RUSH ON AND SEE
atnd_PF-Lbs_2	OH GOD IS AS BAD
VbQk4H8hgr0_40	AND THE CHARACTERS JUST WEREN'T THE SAME AS THE FIRST TWO THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_3	SO I REALLY WAS NOT LOOKING FOR HER TO SEE THIS MOVIE
Bfr499ggo-0_22	GOOD BUT IF YOU DON'T EXPECT A LOT I THINK YOU ENJOY IT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_11	THEY DID VERY WELL TO ESTABLISH THE CHARACTER OF THOR
6Egk_28TtTM_11	AND I THINK THAT WHY I WOULD BE SCARED IS BECAUSE I FEEL SCARED AND KIND OF SAD IF I LOST MY OWN MOTHER
G-xst2euQUc_5	AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED ABOUT THIS MOVING
LSi-o-IrDMs_21	AH BUT THIS LOOKED AMAZING IT WAS REALLY GOOD
73jzhE8R1TQ_6	SO I REALLY WAS PRETTY GOOD IN MY OPINION
d6hH302o4v8_29	KNOW THEY TIS TRIED SO HARDLY WITH THE SEASIDE THAT THEY PUT THE KNITTING LICKER SO I'S A JAY AT YOU
cW1FSBF59ik_13	SAME WITH AWE WADE'S OF ALL SORTS AND I CAN'T HELP IT
vvZ4IcEtiZc_1	AND I REALLY REALLY LOVED IT AND
BI97DNYfe5I_10	THE CAR THE BLACK BEAUTY THAT WAS AMAZING ALL THE GUNS IN THE CAR THAT WAS REAL SWEET
WKA5OygbEKI_15	AND JOHNNIE UP SOME WONDERFUL VOICE ACTOR SO AH HE HE'S I DON'T KNOW HE'S AN INCREDIBLE VOICE
VbQk4H8hgr0_46	IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER
9T9Hf74oK10_3	THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY SPLIT ABOUT THIS RUBY
73jzhE8R1TQ_9	THE JOB OF EXPLAINING THINGS WITH LOREEN AND MOGADORIANS THE NUMBER OF
9c67fiY0wGQ_8	RECOMMENDS FILMS OF SIX IN UP
HEsqda8_d0Q_7	THE END PART IS REALLY REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE
d6hH302o4v8_24	IT WAS VERY VERY VERY FINE
vyB00TXsimI_22	AND THERE ACTUALLY WAS ONE SCENE THAT I FOUND
8OtFthrtaJM_19	BUT JUST ASIDE FROM THAT THEY REALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THE SUSPENSEFUL PARTS
zhpQhgha_KU_12	OH IT ALSO REALLY DIDN'T NEED A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT IT HAD IN IT
c7UH_rxdZv4_19	YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL FUNNY JOKES
2WGyTLYerpo_62	VERY GOOD TIME
d3_k5Xpfmik_6	IT CONTAINS M REALLY WELL KNOWN AND FAITHFUL HOMAGES TO THEE ZUMBI HORACE SOJOURNRA AND M
atnd_PF-Lbs_16	BUT THE WAVES POURED OFF IT SO WELL THAT WAS SICK
tIrG4oNLFzE_12	WHICH A REALLY ANNOYED ME
LSi-o-IrDMs_28	THAT'S IT IS A GIMMICK ULTIMATELY
k5Y_838nuGo_5	I'M HICCOUGHED QUITE OVERHEATED
BXuRRbG0Ugk_9	THIS PROBABLY HAD THE UNFORTUNATE SIDE EFFECT OF RAISING FAIR EXPECTATIONS TO UNREASONABLE LEVELS
1DmNV9C1hbY_3	IT HAD A REAL STOIC'S BEND TO IT
HEsqda8_d0Q_4	WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE
Njd1F0vZSm4_10	YOU CAN'T TELL WHICH ARE THE GOOD OWLS AND WHICH ARE THE BAD ONES
Clx4VXItLTE_27	ETHEL WAS LAUGHING AFTERWARDS
tmZoasNr4rU_5	MAYBE PLANETEER I'M I'M NOT SURE I'M JUST
VbQk4H8hgr0_5	I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THAT
I5y0__X72p0_5	I I BOTH I I AND
etzxEpPuc6I_17	IT WAS LIKE THE ACTING IT WAS TERRIBLE THE ACTION MADE UP FOR IT
aiEXnCPZubE_14	AND THE UTTER HORRIBLE AND I MEAN ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS CARLITINO ASKED DOCTOR BARRACK GORSEY WHOSE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_2	AT LAST IN THE TITLE THAT THEY THREW ON AT THE THEATRES
c7UH_rxdZv4_22	UM AND THE CHARACTERS DIDN'T CARE WHETHER THEY LIVED OR DIED
ZUXBRvtny7o_17	I MEAN THE BLOOD IS LIKE DRY LIGHT WITH SOME SIGNIFY WITH SOME ACTION AND WITH LIKEABLE CHARACTERS AND THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT GUISE
9qR7uwkblbs_13	A STONE WAS IN AS SMOOTH AS WELL AND HE WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW IT BECAUSE SHE WAS HARDLY IN IT
73jzhE8R1TQ_15	BUT MY OPINION IS THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE AN OFFER HE SHOULDN'T CARE ABOUT THE LATEST TRAINS SO THAT'S REALLY WHEN THEY COME UP
zhpQhgha_KU_35	AND SO IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR A VERY ELOQUENT POSITIVE VIEW CHECK OUT HER VIEW IT IS VERY GOOD I AM
G6GlGvlkxAQ_9	THEY COULD BE CUNNING GET A LITTLE BIT OF CRISPS OR STARVE POWER INTO THAT
OQvJTdtJ2H4_16	THE BEST PART ABOUT THE MOVIE I GOT A FREE PAIR OF THE GLASS
9T9Hf74oK10_4	THERE IS A CERTAIN DEAD HAND NATURE TO IT
2WGyTLYerpo_32	REALLY BAD ASKED
2WGyTLYerpo_1	SAY THAT I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED COWBOYS NEARLY AS
6_0THN4chvY_1	IT'S KIND OF CURIOUS TO SEE MAYBE IF THAT'S WHAT THIS HE WAS GOING FOR AND IT DEFINITELY WAS WHAT THEY WERE GOING FOR
vvZ4IcEtiZc_10	IT'S SORT OF LIKE A CONTRIVED PLOT THAT'S BEEN USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
7JsX8y1ysxY_39	BY NOW HER ALL WAS GOOD
fvVhgmXxadc_4	I'VE HAD A MOSTLY PAIN OUT OF IT
d3_k5Xpfmik_14	IT USES THAT END VIS JUST DOESN'T APPLY TO THE ER ER CRITICS THE SEQUENCE ON ITS OWN BUT APPLIES TO THE MOVIE AS A WHOLE IT REALLY KNOWS HOW TO USE SLOW MOTION WITHOUT MAKING IT A GIMME
9T9Hf74oK10_20	YOU DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
BI97DNYfe5I_12	THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GREAT AND THE GOD WHO PLAYED CATO WHOSE FIRST NAME IS JAY
PZ-lDQFboO8_2	BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS JUST A LITTLE DRY
Qr1Ca94K55A_8	LIKE A SHIP BEFORE IT HAD TACKED MORE MINERS THAT WERE JUST HYSTERICAL
c7UH_rxdZv4_15	BORING
0h-zjBukYpk_13	CARRIED IT
bvLlb-M3UXU_2	NOT A COMPELLING NARRATIVE BY ANY MEANS THERE
phBUpBr1hSo_17	AH THE ACTION WAS GREAT IN IT NOT TOO MUCH NOT TOO LITTLE JUST A JUST ENOUGH ACTION
03bSnISJMiM_11	BLASPHEMY
2WGyTLYerpo_56	LIKE A NEWLY CALLED COWBOY'S MILLIONS A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD THINK WOULD BE KINDLY CRAZY
nzpVDcQ0ywM_20	HE IS AVERAGE
2iD-tVS8NPw_6	AND YOU WANT TO SEE THEM THREE BECAUSE I
Ci-AH39fi3Y_13	AND THE IRRELEVANT PLOT WAS WITH FIVE RANDOM STRANGERS FINALLY
8qrpnFRGt2A_25	AND THEN IT'S ABOUT THAT LEVEL OF THE STARRS
cM3Yna7AavY_4	IF I HAD SOME PIE I'M NOT HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR SAY BUT I WAS DEFINITELY EXPECTING THIS TO BE A GOOD MOVIE
Vj1wYRQjB-o_2	WE ALL SORTS OF COOL GODS THAT IT'S LIKE A DESERT EAGLE BUT HAS TWO BARRELS TO IT
VCslbP0mgZI_9	UM IF LIKE ME OR SOME OTHER WHITE PERSON OR SPANISH PERSON OR WHATEVER DID THE SAME JOKES IT WOULD NOT BE FUNNY
WKA5OygbEKI_17	HE IS REALLY QUIRKY LITTLE CHAMELEON
Ci-AH39fi3Y_26	THE ENDING WAS NOT YOU KNOW CRAZY SHOCKING OR ANYTHING LIKE USUAL
Clx4VXItLTE_10	LIKE IT DOESN'T JUST LIKE AND I WAS IN ALL THAT IS THE PROBLEM THERE'S THE STORY THEN IT'S LIKE STRAIGHTWAY AND THE STORY I STARTED
HEsqda8_d0Q_18	AS AN ENGLISH PERSON I GET REALLY ANNOYED WHEN AMERICAN SHOWS AND FILMS HAVE AN ENGLISH CHARACTER
LSi-o-IrDMs_29	AH BUT I WILL SAY I'M WITH THIS WITH THIS QUALITY OF THREE YOU COULD ALMOST MAKE YOU KNOW A REGULAR LIKE A DRAMATIC MOVIE OR AN ACTION MOVING OR SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY A GOOD MOVIE AND YOU CAN MAKE IT THREE AND IT WOULDN'T AT ALL
GWuJjcEuzt8_10	THAT'S IT I'M WONDERFUL IT
6_0THN4chvY_2	BUT I BET IF YOU PUT HIM NEXT TO THE NEW FILM THE THESIS WOULD BE SOMEWHERE ENOUGH THAT THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO REALLY TELL WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS
IumbAb8q2dM_11	HEARD THAT IN THE BOOK IT DESCRIBES ON THE PLANET OF LORIAN OR BETTER
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_10	UM REALLY FIRST AND FOREMOST IT JUST LACKED THE CHARM OF THESE PAST ROBIN HOOD MOVIES THAT WE KNOW
9J25DZhivz8_6	THIS WAS PROBABLY THE BEST THREE DAY RUBY I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME CAUSE IT ACTUALLY USED THREE D TOY STORY
ob23OKe5a9Q_8	IT WOULD NOT ONLY BE A REAL CASE AND A MEANS OF DEFINITE FEELINGS
6_0THN4chvY_13	IT IS A GREAT ONE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_10	IT'S A BIT OF A MIXED BAG IS THERE SOME VERY BRIGHT MOMENTS
Oz06ZWiO20M_10	UM IT REALLY IS NOT TRYING TO BE A DRAMATIC FILM OR AN ACTION FILM
9T9Hf74oK10_9	UM IN A WAY A LOT OF THE THEMES AND NEVER LET ME GO WHICH WERE VERY PROFOUND AND DEEP
Jkswaaud0hk_1	ME A COON'S IN JEST INTIRELY I THOUGHT THEY'D MADE A GREAT DEAL O ME A COON HAS SHE
cM3Yna7AavY_9	SO I GUESS PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SEE A COMPUTER ANIMATED PHELPS NOW I'M SO
VbQk4H8hgr0_44	IT WAS BORING
OQvJTdtJ2H4_14	THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I THOUGHT A GIANT SCORPION WOULD LOOK WITH A PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD THAT HAD BLUE FIRE ON IT
etzxEpPuc6I_1	I'M SO CHANNING TAILOR IN MARLIN OR TRANSPORTING IT THAT YOU GET AMBUSHED BY AND I THINK IT'S CULPRIT IS NOT HARDLY EXPLAINED BECAUSE
2WGyTLYerpo_55	SOMETIMES IT KIND OF VEERS INTO CLICHY ACTION MOVING TERRITORY
Njd1F0vZSm4_5	COME OFF WHEELING
LSi-o-IrDMs_9	AS FOR THIS KIND OF MOVIE THE PLOT IS IS AS THREADBARE OF THE
MLal-t_vJPM_12	I'M GETTING ANGRY ABOUT IT UNCLE SARAH DOESN'T PLAY THIS CHARACTER IN THIS FILM BUT
c5xsKMxpXnc_1	I THOUGHT THIS RUBY WAS CAN BE REALLY GOOD BECAUSE MY DEMON WAS IN IT AND
tIrG4oNLFzE_8	OUGHT TO EXPECT THE MONEY CYRUS AND I'M SHOWING IT ON THE HANNO AND TENNY FRANCHI'S PLAYING AT ONE CHARACTER WHICH I THINK LIKE THE NINES AT THE TIME HER CHARACTERS LIKE THOSE OF GORGES SO EXAGGERATED SO I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW SHE WAS GOING TO HER HAND ON THE PHONE
f_pcplsH_V0_5	MY OVER OPINION OF THE RESULTS OF THIS PROCESS ALL IS BETTER THAN BETWEEN THREE AND ACTUALLY
W8NXH0Djyww_21	I WAS JUST SO CALLED IN
wMbj6ajWbic_16	BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MOVIE IS REALLY WELL WOULD IT MAKE UP FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT I HAD IN TERMINATE HER SALVATION
03bSnISJMiM_10	THERE WERE SUCH PARTS
WKA5OygbEKI_20	IT DEFINITELY WON'T BUY IT
8qrpnFRGt2A_13	FOR IT THUS IS ME
BI97DNYfe5I_8	YOU KNOW AND THAT'S O K I GUESS
LSi-o-IrDMs_27	AGAIN WHEN IT BURNED OUT ON FREDDY BECAUSE IT'S
tmZoasNr4rU_1	I WANT TO QUICKLY TALK ABOUT YOU SHADY
I5y0__X72p0_37	I DID NOT COUNT LIKE THE ACTION
aiEXnCPZubE_20	THEY YOU KNOW THAT THEY BRING NOTHING TO HIS TABLE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_15	IT WAS SO BAD AND I JUST DID NOT ENJOY IT
73jzhE8R1TQ_10	AND THE NUMBER'S EIGHT AND THEY I'M CONSTRUCTED A BOOK OF BITS OF IT SO I LIKE THAT AND I'M
HEsqda8_d0Q_12	I WAS EXPECTING THAT MUCH
f_pcplsH_V0_14	BUT IT ACTUALLY MAKES THE CHARACTERS NOT JUST OF THE DRAWING ROOM WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE IN BUT OF THEIR OWN FRANCHISE TO A RIDICULOUS EXTENT
2WGyTLYerpo_6	SEMI TOSSED QUERY
jUzDDGyPkXU_22	MOMENTS WERE HE SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU SOUNDED DUMB AS HELL
Clx4VXItLTE_22	IT'S IT'S SO FUNNY
5W7Z1C_fDaE_5	MAKES BIG POWERFUL STATEMENTS
Njd1F0vZSm4_1	I'M GOING TO GIVE THIS A GRADE BE MIDAS
fvVhgmXxadc_1	IT'S ONLY THAT THE POTENTIAL TO BE A FILM WAS BOTH THOUGHT PROVOKING AND ACTION PACKED
7JsX8y1ysxY_21	WHO WAS JUST KICKED ASS HORSON OF TIME WAS THE GUY THAT PLAYED OUR RUSH
LSi-o-IrDMs_20	SOMETIMES REDDY CAN MESS UP THE COLOR AT LEAST THE OLD AN GLYPHIC THREE I THINK WE'LL DO IT YOU'RE NOT THAT SORT OF THAT HAS SO TEMPTED THAT'S IT SO IT'S ALSO I'M NOT IDEAL FOR FOR THE IMAGE ITSELF
iiK8YX8oH1E_10	WE SECOND GUESS OURSELVES
Nzq88NnDkEk_23	I AM I JUST WHAT I DO NOT LIKE IT
6_0THN4chvY_11	I WANT TO SEE HOW I COULD FRAME THAT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_26	AND THE CAST IS PRETTY WELL ROUNDED OUT WITH SUPPORTING PERFORMANCES FROM GUYS LIKE SAM ROCKWELL AS THE DOCK
QN9ZIUWUXsY_18	AND PERSONALLY THIS MAKES NO SENSE
OtBXNcAL_lE_2	I'M MISS LOUISE IS TOM
8qrpnFRGt2A_20	AND THAT'S BECAUSE ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE MOODY I REALIZED THAT THIS IS JUST IT'S REALLY JUST A CARTOON
cM3Yna7AavY_16	OH GOD WHY DID I WATCH THAT RUBY
Sqr0AcuoNnk_8	I WAS NOT BORED DURING NOTIONS ATTACHED
BI97DNYfe5I_26	AH UM BUT YEAH SO THE GREEN HORNET IT WAS O K
bvLlb-M3UXU_10	THE FIRST REASON IS THE OBVIOUS JUST TO MAKE A EXCITING ENJOYABLE ACTION FILM
yDtzw_Y-7RU_24	WOULD NOT TAKE A YOUNG CHILD
k5Y_838nuGo_17	THERE HAD ADULT HUMOUR IN IT
c7UH_rxdZv4_12	NO NO HE'S FUNNY NOT FUNNY AT ALL
d6hH302o4v8_41	DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE
VbQk4H8hgr0_4	AND I JUST PLAIN DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING NEW TO OFFER
Ci-AH39fi3Y_19	SO IT WAS REALLY REALLY STRANGE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_14	I LIKE TIERED UP IN FRONT OF RABBITS BECAUSE OF HIM
tmZoasNr4rU_4	KNOW IT IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY MAY BE SEVENTY'S EXPLOITATION MOVIES ARE MORE CHESSY THAN THE SHADY
GWuJjcEuzt8_7	CAUSE WHEN YOU SEE HER FACE MOVES AND FEELS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU FEEL WORRIED FOR HER YOU
tmZoasNr4rU_2	I'M SORRY AND DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THIS I DIDN'T LIKE IT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_10	GOUVERET THIS ISN'T THE BEST RIDER DEAFENING BUT OVER ALL
Nzq88NnDkEk_31	HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE SCREENINGS ON THE MAPS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_3	IT'S REALLY GLOSSED OVER WITH LOTS OF STUNNING SPECIAL EFFECTS AND BIG EXPLOSIONS
G-xst2euQUc_7	AH THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE TO TAKE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO THE MOVIES
Bfr499ggo-0_5	AFFECTATIONS A FEW PET PEAS CARRIED WARD MOST OF HER RENDED HIDEOUS HATS THEY WERE NOT FASHIONABLE AND
aiEXnCPZubE_15	ACCENT IS SO AWFUL
1iG0909rllw_3	THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO BUY CAP'N HERBERT BUT THAT SHE REALLY RATHER ENJOYABLE
cW1FSBF59ik_14	UMMMMM MARVEL ONCE AGAIN DECIDED TO TOSS ANOTHER ROUND IN THE MOODY
6_0THN4chvY_5	STORIES PRETTY SIMPLE
MLal-t_vJPM_9	AND IT'S REALLY WELL WRITTEN
7JsX8y1ysxY_26	THE OTHER GUY THAT DID A REALLY GOOD JOB WAS A JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN
Clx4VXItLTE_2	NOT FOR SOME ONE LIKE ME WHO LOVES HARMONIES AND
GWuJjcEuzt8_12	IS DROPPED IN GORGES BY THE WAY BY
Af8D0E4ZXaw_9	APOLOGY AND ONE OF OTHERS HAS NEVER GOT TO GIVE YOU ONE
X3j2zQgwYgE_10	THE FOREWARNED THE EXPECTATIONS
7JsX8y1ysxY_27	HE READ THE JOB
VbQk4H8hgr0_7	AND OFFERED NOTHING OF THE SUCH IT WASN'T
vyB00TXsimI_2	IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE THAT HAS ANYTHING REALISTIC IN IT YOU SHOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS INSANE
v0zCBqDeKcE_4	AH I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT IT'S NOT LIKE A AMAZING LEAGUE AND WHEN SOME OF WARD'S GOOD
6_0THN4chvY_7	I'M FUNNY JOKES OF THE KID'S GET
2WGyTLYerpo_42	YOU CAN CARE ABOUT HIM
cW1FSBF59ik_21	AND YOU PROBABLY DID THE BEST FOR SALE TO WHICH WAS EDMUND
lXPQBPVc5Cw_5	I DON'T LIKE THE MORE OLD THESE CRIED IKE STONES I GUESS I'M THE OLD MAN PICKS UP A TOY STORY IN ALL THAT STUFF
W8NXH0Djyww_29	AH ONE THING I DIDN'T LIKE IT ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THE BIRTH OF THE MINK HERE ARE THE BAD CHARACTER I SHOULD SAY IN CONDOLATE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_20	WELL WHY ARE THEY HERE
etzxEpPuc6I_8	IN SOME PARTS SHE HAD PEOPLE GETTING KILLED AT THE NEXT PART TO HAVE FAR JOKES AND STUPID FRIENDS WHO WERE IN ALL OTHER CRABS
Clx4VXItLTE_19	I JOINED A HELL OF OTHER TIMES
ZUXBRvtny7o_23	REALLY THIS MORNING
1DmNV9C1hbY_12	SURE THOUGH A LITTLE TOO FUNNY PARTS AND NOT MIXED IN WITH A
iiK8YX8oH1E_3	YELLS AND SCREAMS THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE AND
MLal-t_vJPM_11	ONE I'M GETTING A LITTLE SICK OF THE MICHAEL SARAH KIND OF LEAD CHARACTER THE SORT OF REALLY AWKWARD BOY WHO IS REALLY AWKWARD AND STUFF YOU KNOW I'M GETTING SICK OF THAT CHARACTER AND I'M TIRED OF HIM AND
VCslbP0mgZI_3	THE OWL LAND AND WHEN THEY CAME OUT AND THERE SAW
bOL9jKpeJRs_11	THAT WAS NOT REALLY PROTECTED
Ci-AH39fi3Y_21	AND I TOTALLY MADE UP FOR THAT SIR
BXuRRbG0Ugk_10	WHEN I SAW THE FIRST TRAILER BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR THIS MOVING IMMEDIATELY SHOT UP NEAR THE TOP OF MY LIST OF MUST SEE MOVIES FOR TWENTY ELEVEN THE FINAL
dq3Nf_lMPnE_8	FOR MISS IS OUT ON THE MAGIC THAT MADE THE FIRST FILM A REAL JOY TO VIEW
G-xst2euQUc_11	AH IT HAS IT HAS A VERY PREDICTABLE STORY
1iG0909rllw_29	THE REST OF THE FILM WAS JUST WATCHING CHRISTEN'S MOPE AROUND
dq3Nf_lMPnE_3	DREAM WORKS IS CONFUSING ME
0h-zjBukYpk_18	I MEAN IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO TAKE OFF THE COSTUME OR SOMETHING
6_0THN4chvY_8	I LOVE THE SCENE WHERE YOU ARE IN WHO THINK THAT OWL IS GETTING SICK
aiEXnCPZubE_7	AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE HATING ON THE FILM BECAUSE I REALLY DO LOVE IT
cXypl4FnoZo_28	I WAS I'M HERE WAS ANNOYING
yDtzw_Y-7RU_19	THE PEOPLE SEEM SORT OF DEAD
Af8D0E4ZXaw_27	THE ACTING RANGES FROM MEDIOCRE TO HAND FISTED FROM THE LIVE ACTION ACTORS
aiEXnCPZubE_30	THE ACTION IN THE MOVIE IS SO WELL USED
phBUpBr1hSo_12	I DON'T THINK A MOVIE CAN EVER BE TOO LONG A WHAT I LIKE YOU KNOW OF THE DARK NIGHT IT WAS YOU KNOW TWO HOURS AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES YOU KNOW I'M TITANIC AND ALL THOSE MOVIES THE AVATAR ALWAYS MOVES THAT ARE YOU KNOW THREE HOURS AND YOU KNOW THAT'S FINE BY ME I LIKE LONG MOVIES
9qR7uwkblbs_26	I DO NOT LIKE A SERIOUS LOOK A MOVE OR ANYTHING
GWuJjcEuzt8_16	ONLY ALSO MOVIES THAT WE HAD IN THE MIDDLE OF INCEPTION AND BLACKS ON END YOU KNOW THE SOCIAL AS WELL
vyB00TXsimI_3	IF YOU LIKE EXPLOSIONS REALLY RIDICULOUS ACTION SEQUENCES MELODRAMATIC PLOTS AND ACTING THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVIE TO SEE
bvLlb-M3UXU_24	IT'S I FELT KIND OF CUTTIN DRY I WOULD
tmZoasNr4rU_11	ALTHOUGH I'D LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU IN THE LIGHT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_27	I CALL THEE I LIKE THE CASS
zhpQhgha_KU_4	THAT'S FOR THE ARSH
fvVhgmXxadc_14	ALTHOUGH THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST COMPARISONS THAT THIS FILM ACTUALLY WOULD BE TO MY PEN'S LABYRINTH
7JsX8y1ysxY_22	FOR AS HE WAS ASKED WHEN HE'S
G6GlGvlkxAQ_22	I THINK THE DIRECTORS OF THOR AND THE SCRIBBLERS DO NOT RIGHT AWAY
zhpQhgha_KU_19	I THINK THAT AH AND EVERYBODY I DO FEEL REALLY BAD FOR CHARLOTTE
9qR7uwkblbs_28	TOM REALLY I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED MYSELF FOR NOT REALIZING THE TWIST BEFORE IT ACTUALLY TWISTED BECAUSE
8OtFthrtaJM_13	WHICH CAN'T JUST RUINS THE SUSPENSE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE IF THEY'VE GOT SOME CONVENIENT GUY AND A FEDORA I JUST TELL YOU OH YES WE ARE THE ADDRESS AT BERYL AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO IN I JUST KIND OF RUINS THE SUSPENSE AND
atnd_PF-Lbs_3	I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GO TO THE LOAVES TO MAKE A WHOLE NAME IN IT WITH YOU ABOUT THIS MOVIE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_2	BUT OVER ALL I GO SEE IT
OtBXNcAL_lE_4	BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND MOVIES THAT ARE SO PREDICTABLE
2WGyTLYerpo_8	THE VISUAL EFFECTS ARE PRETTY COOL
zhpQhgha_KU_8	BUT ALL IN ALL I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY OVER OVERLY SAD
rnaNMUZpvvg_2	IT WAS A FUNNY EXPERIENCE GOING LIKE
8d-gEyoeBzc_24	ACTUALLY FOUND AND WHEN HE SOON CAME UP IT SLOWED THE MOVING DOWN AND THEN THIS IS THE PROBLEM AND WE'VE PREDATORY PREDATORY AS COMPETITOR
cW1FSBF59ik_3	AND PREACHING THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN CANNOT IF WE DEAL THE WHOLE TIME YOU KNOW
cXypl4FnoZo_24	WE HADN'T WANTED TO BE LIKE THAT EXCEPT NOT AS OBVIOUS BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD RIGHT LIKE BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE THEM A REASON CAUSE THEY WANTED TO GET MARRIED BUT THEY COULDN'T BECAUSE SHE'S GOOD MARY AND I
bvLlb-M3UXU_13	THE SECOND REASON THIS MOVE WAS MADE AND IN MY OPINION THE REAL REASON IS MADE AGAIN IT'S THE LETTERS TOLONE TELLING HIMSELF I'VE STILL GOT IT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_10	THE SECOND ONE HAD IT WOULDN'T ACTING IN SOME PLACE OF I'M SORRY
ZAIRrfG22O0_2	IT WAS A WASTED TIME
ZUXBRvtny7o_11	I REALLY THE SPECIAL EFFECTS OF THIS MORNING
Nzq88NnDkEk_10	I JUST FELL LIKE IT WAS IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A RUSH MOVIE
bvLlb-M3UXU_17	BUT HE WOULD AND HE'S SHOWN THAT YAH MAYBE HE'S NOT WHAT HE WAS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BUT HE STILL HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE BUILT AS AN ACTION STAR
tStelxIAHjw_10	I DON'T THINK IT WAS SAD
9qR7uwkblbs_33	AND
I5y0__X72p0_19	THEY CONVINCE ME LIKE THIS CHICK COULD PROBABLY TAKE THAT DO DOWN WHICH IS PRETTY HARD
Clx4VXItLTE_16	SHE WANTED TO GO HOME AND THAT'S I'VE SEEN A LOVE FOR HER CAUSE SHE LIKES HER REMOVES AS MUCH AS I DO
9T9Hf74oK10_22	BUT IT'S ER IT'S SOMEWHAT MODERN I WOULD SAY
W8NXH0Djyww_23	OUR SOFA
2iD-tVS8NPw_23	YOU DON'T ENTIRELY KNOW WHAT'S COMING NEXT
etzxEpPuc6I_14	BUT THE THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS JUST A MOVIE ABOUT A ER A DOLL SAID HE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY
VbQk4H8hgr0_13	THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL THE SAME AND
POKffnXeBds_7	I MEAN THE MORE HE WAS I GET AT THE WASTE OF TIME WITH
2iD-tVS8NPw_30	NOT LIKE THE GREEN LANTERN IS THAT NEXT BEND AND BEGINS OR THE DARK NIGHT
tIrG4oNLFzE_9	THE WAY OF MY FATHER'S ACTING MY FATHER'S ACTING THE LIKE OF SHE HAD THE SAME
Oz06ZWiO20M_19	THEM COMPELLING IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS COMPELLING AND THEN HAVE A STORY THAT'S LIKE AT FIVE MINUTES THIS HAPPENS IN TEN MINUTES THIS HAPPENS THAT LIKE MOVES FORWARD AND HAS MOMENTUM
aiEXnCPZubE_12	THE MISSES INCLUDE YOU KNOW VENICE A HUDSON'S
cXypl4FnoZo_8	BUT I'M I I LIKE SEEING ON FEMALE DIRECTORS BECAUSE THERE ARE THAT MANY A COMPARED TO YOU DON'T GUIDE OR ACTORS
03bSnISJMiM_12	IT WAS REALLY REAL
PZ-lDQFboO8_12	BUT AS FAR AS CAME THROUGH PAN GOES I WAS HOPING FOR A LOT MORE IT JUST WASN'T THERE FOR ME OH NO
k5Y_838nuGo_7	THE THIRD WAS A PIECE OF CRAB
VCslbP0mgZI_1	SO I
jUzDDGyPkXU_27	THEY WERE ALL JUST REALLY BLAND AND FORGETTABLE
k5Y_838nuGo_11	UM I I DIDN'T ENJOY IT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_14	JOHN FERVOUR IS PROBABLY NOT THE GUY THAT I WOULD HIRE IF I WAS LOOKING FOR A DIRECTOR FOR AN ACTION MOVIE
bOL9jKpeJRs_34	I KNOW YOU GIRLS
Bfr499ggo-0_10	THERE ARE A FEW NICE MOMENTS
tIrG4oNLFzE_14	SHE SAID WHAT SHE THINKING HOW SHE FELT I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS THE SAME EXPRESSION THE SHOCK OF THE SADNESS OR WHAT PRESUMED SHE SAID BUT IT REALLY LOVED ME AND
f9O3YtZ2VfI_30	MY NEIGHBOUR PROBABLY THINKS I'M CRAZY FEELING ABOUT MOVIES TO A CAMERA OH
bOL9jKpeJRs_17	WHO WAS IN THE ROOM
bvLlb-M3UXU_1	AND IT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IT IS NOT
ZUXBRvtny7o_13	AMASSING HIS PERSONAL EFFECTS
03bSnISJMiM_1	ANYHOW IT WAS REALLY GOOD
IumbAb8q2dM_19	HE WAS UNBELIEVABLE
atnd_PF-Lbs_21	THE RACE DID HIM SEEN AND THE MOTH SEEDS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE END WERE MASSIVE ANTS OF PEOPLE DYED IN THE CRAZIEST WAYS OUR PRETTY GOOD FOR LATE NIGHT BUDDY BEWINGS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY A LATE NIGHT BUDDY
pLTX3ipuDJI_6	UGLY ACTING NOTHING STANDS OUT AS PARTICULAR WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED OF A MOVIE LIKE THIS
jUzDDGyPkXU_24	I CAN'T READ THAT AND MY HUMPH I MEAN I NEVER SAID ANYTHING REALLY THAT MATTERS AND HIS MOVING
Nzq88NnDkEk_18	ACTUALLY BECAUSE I SAID NEXT TO ME ACTUALLY HE WAS TAKING A NAP HE KEPT DOZING OFF
jUzDDGyPkXU_7	DIDN'T REALLY SEE A COMPARISON TO BLACK HAWK DOWN TILL LIKE THE VERY VERY END
rnaNMUZpvvg_22	I SAT WITH THE GUYS AND WE ALL TRIED TO STAY AWAKE THROUGH IT AND KEPT FALLING ASLEEP AND THEN TALKED OF HOW STUPID IT WAS
d6hH302o4v8_12	HE'S A GOOD LITTLE BOY
BioHAh1qJAQ_8	THE BEST SUMMER MOVING I'VE SEEN ALL YEAR
IumbAb8q2dM_1	I ALWAYS LIKE TO READ THE BOOK FIRST
BioHAh1qJAQ_30	AND IT'S LIKE JUDE YOU'RE COMPUTER PROGRAMME OKAY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD USING REAL PEOPLE IT'S THE WORST WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT WE'LL TREAT SOME COMPUTER SYSTEMS SOMEWHERE AND DETONATES THEM
ZUXBRvtny7o_24	THAT PICTURE WAS GREEDY GREGG
8d-gEyoeBzc_27	FELT THE MOVING SLOWED DOWN WHERE IS IT YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
BI97DNYfe5I_1	AND IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
c5xsKMxpXnc_2	I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED
v0zCBqDeKcE_7	GENIUS I MEAN SOME PEOPLE LIKE JAMES'S WOODS I BELIEVE HIS I Q IS ONE ONE EIGHTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
vyB00TXsimI_5	AND THIS FRONT WATCH
BXuRRbG0Ugk_11	THE FINAL PRODUCT ULTIMATELY DOESN'T LIVE UP TO THE HIGH BORDER THAT FIRST TRAILER BUT
W8NXH0Djyww_8	AND NOW WHAT I LONGED ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS LIKE THE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE
0h-zjBukYpk_24	THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE
I5y0__X72p0_2	AT FIRST WHEN I SAW THE PREVIOUS I THOUGHT I WAS GOING STUPID TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
c7UH_rxdZv4_14	I'M CATO KICK'S ASS HANDSOME GUY
I5y0__X72p0_14	IT'S A KIND OF FEELS LIKE A SUN DANCE FOUND FESTIVAL TO IT
Iu2PFX3z_1s_11	THAT YOU RESPECT THAT JOE WRIGHT TRIED TO DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HERE
cXypl4FnoZo_18	HE I DON'T I THINK HE MAYBE HE GOT MAD WHEN I DON'T
0h-zjBukYpk_25	I LIKE THAT SCENE FOR WHEN HE HAS A SWORD AND THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO SHOOT HIM PUT HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND TAKE IT OUT AND WE'LL GO TOGETHER NOW TAKE THAT WITH MY MAGICAL SWORDS
VCslbP0mgZI_14	BUT JACK'S NIGHT IS A GUY AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS STUFF KIND ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE HE MADE A WOMAN HATERS CLUB
1iG0909rllw_19	THE SIXTY TWO SIXTY MOMENTS WERE DRAWN OUT TO THE MARKS AS FAR AS THEY COULD GO AND
I5y0__X72p0_12	ARARD BANNAD SAYS TO TRYING TO BE THIS THE MOST PARANOY ASSASSIN SHAKE IN THE WORLD BECAUSE
9qR7uwkblbs_5	I THINK THAT THEY PERSONALLY THOUGHT RACHEL WHITE'S REALLY FOLK IN LOVE SUITS AND WEARING GOSLING SO THEY MADE THIS MOVE YOU WITH ME AND MY LIKE
9J25DZhivz8_22	THERE WAS A LOT OF CHEAP CHILD'S HUMOR WHICH
Iu2PFX3z_1s_14	IT'S REALLY NON STOP FROM BEGINNING TO END
lXPQBPVc5Cw_26	DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANY MORE OF THIS
f9O3YtZ2VfI_26	A REALLY LIKE DAVID FINISHED
1iG0909rllw_23	ALL THE MOMENTS IN THIS YOU JUST THE WHOLE THING WAS LAUGHING
Oz06ZWiO20M_4	I WOULD SAY I I ENJOYED
BvYR0L6f2Ig_6	AND BY THE SOUND OF THE BRUSH PLOT THAT YOU MAY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE
BioHAh1qJAQ_3	AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTY'S PEOPLE FIND THE COMPUTERS IN YOU IF ANYTHING
2WGyTLYerpo_46	HE'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
8d-gEyoeBzc_3	ER WHICH THING RODRIGUES WAS GOING FOR HIM THAT HE ALWAYS SAID WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DO AS HE CALLED IT AND HE WANTED THIS TO BE ER THE PREDATORY EQUIVALENT OF ALIENS
W8NXH0Djyww_11	LIKE THE DUMB KIND OF COWBOYS THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING ALWAYS ASKING DUMB QUESTIONS AIN'T SAYIN STUPID SHIP
ZUXBRvtny7o_3	BUT I WON'T AND I DID DISOBEY
ZUXBRvtny7o_5	GUESS I HAD A GOOD TIME
Jkswaaud0hk_13	HE HAS ADDED A GREAT DIMENSIONS TO THE MOON AS WELL
G-xst2euQUc_2	DID NOT THINK I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT
pLTX3ipuDJI_5	YOU DON'T SEE ANY OTHER PERSONALITIES WHEN ONE DIES YOU DON'T MOURN OVER THEM AND YOU DON'T GAIN AN ATTACHMENT TO ANYBODY
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_11	OVER ALL I ENJOYED IT
I5y0__X72p0_35	BUT IT WAS IT WAS INTERESTING
OtBXNcAL_lE_5	I JUST I CAN'T STAND MOVIES OR IT'S LIKE THE SAME PLOT IS LIKE FIFTY OTHER MILLION MOVIES
_dI--eQ6qVU_11	FEEL LIKE IF THEY WOULDN'T HAVE INSERTED THE HUMOR INTO THIS LOUISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST TOO SERIOUS AND HAD A BORING IN A SENSE
6_0THN4chvY_3	AH IT'S IT'S GREAT IF YOU REMEMBER THOSE OLD FILMS
7JsX8y1ysxY_7	OH THERE COULDN'T BE LESS SOUR BLUE ODDITY WE COULD
d6hH302o4v8_22	IT WOULD ONLY BE WELL
7JsX8y1ysxY_17	SHE LOOKS LIKE A SOUVENIR
Nzq88NnDkEk_32	AND I AM LOOKING REALLY FOR TO SEE THE NAME OF HIS SON
WKA5OygbEKI_3	AM I I'D LIKE TO BOTHER THE MOVIE
f_pcplsH_V0_4	BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE ONE MORE SENSE HAVING TO BE ABLE TO BE EVERYWHERE IF THERE'S TWO OF THEM
nzpVDcQ0ywM_9	BUT IF YOU ARE A CHILD WHO GREW UP IN THAT TIME PERIOD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ENJOY THIS MOVING VERY MUCH BECAUSE
8d-gEyoeBzc_20	I'LL GET SOME FUNNY AND IF HE WON'T LINE HIS LITTLE COIN QUITE FUNNY
GWuJjcEuzt8_6	AND HER FACE DOESN'T MOVE AT ALL
VCslbP0mgZI_2	PUNCH WHO PERFECTLY IN THEATRES STARVING NO ONE YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF DIRECTED
1iG0909rllw_13	I ALREADY APPRECIATE THAT LOYALTY
cW1FSBF59ik_1	PROBABLY WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE FAILED AND MOST FAILED MOVIES OF THE EXCELLENT FRAGILES
aiEXnCPZubE_24	ACTON COULD BE BETTER AND HIS VERY BETTER
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_5	I DIDN'T MIND IT
tIrG4oNLFzE_3	I REALLY ENJOYED A WALK TO REMEMBER ME AND DEAR JOHN
2iD-tVS8NPw_17	I THINK ONE OUGHT TO MAKE THIS YOUNG MOVIE THIS LIFE ACTION WE'LL BE INTO A PROTRUDE OF THAT
nzpVDcQ0ywM_5	I FEEL LIKE IT ALMOST SHOULD HAVE HAD A G RATING
Iu2PFX3z_1s_2	AND HE WHAT HE DOES WITH HANNAH IS HE MAKES A MOVIE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE SEEN BEFORE
ZAIRrfG22O0_3	WERE A FEW FUNNY LINES
5W7Z1C_fDaE_21	DO I SAY FUN TO WATCH IN A REALLY MESSED UP KIND OF WAY
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_16	SUFFERS FROM WHAT I CALL A KINGDOM OF HEAVEN CINDERUM WHERE IT BUILDS TOO MUCH FOR THESE HUGE CATASTROPHIC WAR SEQUENCES THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BLOW YOU AWAY BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU DON'T GIVE IT DAMN BECAUSE IT JUST LACKS THE CHARM OF THE PAST MOVIES
OQvJTdtJ2H4_10	ABOUT ONE AND A HALF HOURS SO
yDtzw_Y-7RU_22	I THINK SHE LIKED THE FILM
cXypl4FnoZo_16	DON'T KNOW HOW TO LIKE TELL YOU WHO HE IS WITHOUT YOU BEING LIKE THAT DOESN'T NO DOUBT AT ALL
9T9Hf74oK10_10	THEY WEREN'T FULLY EXPLORED
rnaNMUZpvvg_9	LIKABLE JUST THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHARACTER OF THE DOCTOR HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON I EVEN REALLY CARED ABOUT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_8	IT'S NOT MY FORM SO
W8NXH0Djyww_28	I WAITED FOUR OR FIVE STARS
I5y0__X72p0_10	I MEAN I DON'T REGRET SAYING IT
I5y0__X72p0_25	IT'S A GOOD ACTION IF IT'S LIKE
d6hH302o4v8_3	HE'S ALWAYS IN THIS CAN'T MOVE HE'S ALWAYS SORCERER WHICH LULU CANNIES
GWuJjcEuzt8_14	YOU KNOW IT MATTERS THE WHOLE THEME OF THE MOVIE YOU KNOW CABARET AND YOU KNOW THE WORKS
9T9Hf74oK10_21	I THINK IT TAKES PLACE SOME TIME AND IT'S I DON'T THINK IT'S PRESENT DAY
cM3Yna7AavY_3	YOU KNOW OF COURSE I WAS WAITING FOR THE PRINCESS AND THE FRAUD
BioHAh1qJAQ_24	CALLED I AS OS AND SAYS I OR WHY DO WE NEED THESE THINGS
PZ-lDQFboO8_6	BUT AS FAR AS HUMOUR GOES NOT AS MUCH AS I WAS EXPECTING
1iG0909rllw_12	VERY VERY LOYAL TO THE BOOK AND
bvLlb-M3UXU_25	JUST THIS SORT OF PLANNING I WISH IT HAD HAPPENED EARLIER IN YOUR CAREER'S
IumbAb8q2dM_14	AND IT TURNS OUT THAT JIM'S FRIEND WHO AM I REALLY LIKE TO HEAR
HEsqda8_d0Q_26	EVEN THOUGH I WAS LIKE HER I COULD HATE IT
dq3Nf_lMPnE_1	AND GROWTH IN THE CHARACTERS IS USUALLY A PATH OF DISCOVERY
QN9ZIUWUXsY_13	BUT WHAT IT LACKS IN THOSE AREAS IT MOST DEFINITELY MAKES UP FOR JUST LIKE SHEER VISUAL SPECTACLE
d3_k5Xpfmik_17	BUT IT'S A VERY KIND OF THEM STYLISH STICK EDGE ON IT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_13	AND IN THE MOON WE WAS PRETTY SHORT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_16	AND THROUGHOUT THE FILMY GOING GAW WOOP WOOP WOOP EITHER FROM THE TERRIFYING CHARACTERS OR
QN9ZIUWUXsY_1	THE MAIN DRAW FOR ME FOR THIS MOVIE WAS JUST THE FACT THAT IT SET IN THE SACRED RIDICULOUS WORLD WITH ALL THESE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL COLOURS AND RIDICULOUS ACTION SEQUENCES
HEsqda8_d0Q_15	DON'T YOU KIND OF FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS THREE DAY THE VOICES
1iG0909rllw_25	MY FAVOURITE SCENES WOULD HAVE TO BE THEATORY AND
Ci-AH39fi3Y_17	THAT WAS REALLY BIZARRE AND I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AT ALL
5W7Z1C_fDaE_23	ONLY GOT SOME FUN CAPTAIN SMITH'S MOMENTS IN IT FOR YOU TO LAUGH WITH AH YES
IumbAb8q2dM_20	SO EASY ON THE
0h-zjBukYpk_10	BUT YOU KNOW HE DID IT
IumbAb8q2dM_5	SO GOOD I'M
Iu2PFX3z_1s_6	NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_14	DID SEEM TO FOCUS TOO MUCH ON EPIC EPIC EPIC
nzpVDcQ0ywM_10	THEY AREN'T PLAYING TO YOU THEY'RE PLAYING TO A NEW AUDIENCE OF KIDS WHO DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE CHARACTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE
73jzhE8R1TQ_14	SO SHE SINCE WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION IS LIKE THEY COULD BE LIKE SCRAPING BY AND OR THEY COULD BE TOLD YOU RICH
5W7Z1C_fDaE_3	IT'S BOLD IT'S
Clx4VXItLTE_30	IT'S KIND OF LIKE QUITE LIKE LIKE IT'S JUST I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT I WAS LIKE WHAT WHAT YOU'D DO IN
atnd_PF-Lbs_19	THERE AIN'T SUCH A THING NOWADAYS
WKA5OygbEKI_13	OH IT HASN'T REALLY GOOD REFERENCES OF PAST YEARNING UP FILMS IN IT LIKE WHILE THE CHAMELEON'S GETTING BOUNCED ALONG THE HIGHWAY RUNNING TO HENDERS THOMPSON
Oz06ZWiO20M_5	I WAS MORE ENTERTAINED BY IT THAN BATTLE ALONE WHICH WAS JUST A SLUG AND BORING AND I JUST FOUND IT TOTALLY UNINTERESTING
nbWiPyCm4g0_10	MIRANDA MIRANDA WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS
7JsX8y1ysxY_19	THERE'S A VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS
2WGyTLYerpo_14	SEEMS LIKE CRAZY
pLTX3ipuDJI_2	I LIKE TO TEASE IT'S A MYSTERY IN GREAT THOUGHT WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN BUT THEN IT ALL WAS EXPLAINED IN A DISAPPEARANCE MINUTE LATER THIS WAS A CLEAR REMAKE OF PRINTER FROM BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WITH THE PROMISE BEING ALMOST IDENTICAL
9qR7uwkblbs_2	ACTUALLY REALLY CHUCKING LOVE THIS MOODY
bvLlb-M3UXU_22	IT'S LOST A LOT OF FEELIN IT WAS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_28	I REALLY DON'T CARE THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE WALKING CROCHETS WHEN THEY'RE THIS WELL DONE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_14	BUT THE AUDIENCE WAS WATCHING IT AND GETTING A PAIL FOR IT AWAY
1DmNV9C1hbY_6	I SAW NO REASON WHY HE'S TO BRING BACK THE VILLAIN FROM THE FIRST ONE
Qr1Ca94K55A_14	AH BUT IF YOU AVEN'T MOVED ABOUT LIKE I AM I'VE TOTALLY RECOMMENDED THIS BECAUSE IT'S JUST A FUN ENTERTAINING MOVIE AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL ENJOY IT
Bfr499ggo-0_9	BUT IN ALL THE PREMISES O K AND
Af8D0E4ZXaw_15	I ALSO OF THE CASTING OF MARKS DURING HIS CELESTIAL HE'S
BioHAh1qJAQ_13	AND AT ONCE SAM FLYNN AND THROWS THE GRID IN ALL THE SOUND TRACK DRAWS YOU IN
ZUXBRvtny7o_19	I'D LIKE TO GO TO SOME OF THEM
BXuRRbG0Ugk_30	COWBOYS AND ALIENS PROBLEM IS THE SCREEN PLAY
bOL9jKpeJRs_24	OH IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD
c7UH_rxdZv4_4	I TRULY LOVE AN ACTION FOR ACTION COMEDY LOOK EVEN BETTER RIGHT
0h-zjBukYpk_22	I THOUGHT HE MADE A GOOD ACTOR FOR THE DEAD POE CHARACTER
OQvJTdtJ2H4_7	THEY PRETEND LIKE SKINNY THE BIG SCENE IT MAY BE LASTED ABOUT A MINUTE AND IT'S LIKE ISN'T IT
I5y0__X72p0_15	GOD BY AND BY
phBUpBr1hSo_16	YOU JUST COME LIKE OKAY IT'S GET TO IT WE KNOW WHAT WE CAN HAVE LET'S GO AHEAD AND DO IT
phBUpBr1hSo_6	AND HE SAID THAT THIS NEW ONE HAS A LOT OF HARD ON A SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_20	AND THEN I THOUGHT IT WORKED PRETTY WELL
WKA5OygbEKI_11	I SOMETHING I I YOU I I A MAN UNLESS
Nzq88NnDkEk_22	OR GIT IT TOTIN I'M A RED BOX FOR A BUCK
phBUpBr1hSo_18	AH THE STORY WAS ALL RIGHT
TvyZBvOMOTc_6	IF I THINK YOU WERE HONESTLY THE PLOT WASN'T THAT GREAT
1iG0909rllw_17	WASN'T IT REALLY AT THE BEST THE MOST THRILLING READ OVER ALL THE SAILOR SO OVER IT
c5xsKMxpXnc_14	NO REASON WHY IT SHOULD BE TOGETHER
2WGyTLYerpo_51	SUCH AS SOMETIMES THE ALIENS IN THE WESTERN SETTING DO LOOK A LITTLE GRUMPY
2WGyTLYerpo_15	GAVE ME CHILLS
lXPQBPVc5Cw_4	I MEAN I DON'T ACTUALLY GO AND I'M NOT BEING BIASED BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY GO FOR THE ANIMATED TYPE FILMS
5W7Z1C_fDaE_12	LEO WILL HAVE CREEPED UP TO HER IN HER BED WITH A TINY LITTLE SMILE
LSi-o-IrDMs_13	IS A TERRIBLE PICTURE OF IT
aiEXnCPZubE_8	WHOEVER A BROWNING IS JUST FAILS TO THE LIVER
jUzDDGyPkXU_20	THEY SAY JUST SOUNDS SO FUCKING STUPID
9c67fiY0wGQ_2	BUT I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF ENJOYING THE RUBY AND LAUGHING
BvYR0L6f2Ig_12	BUT THAT MOST OF THE ACTORS WERE SO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ME THE POLICE CONFIDENT SAID PRIVILY
ZAIRrfG22O0_9	BUT THERE'S STUFFY FOR A BETTER REASON THAT YOU CANNOT GO SEE THEN I'M THE VEN ZO KEEPER SO THAT
phBUpBr1hSo_9	TOO MUCH TOO FAST I MEAN WE BASICALLY JUST GET INTRODUCED TO THIS CHARACTER IN A RIGHT WAY I'M THE FIRST SHE'S IN AND YOU'RE ALREADY YOU KNOW MEANT TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER AND ALL THAT GOOD SLUSHY
cW1FSBF59ik_2	BUT FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO SAY LITTLE WOLVERINE JAMES OH JIMMY HE'S SO GLAD THAT I'M ANYWAY
vyB00TXsimI_6	THE REALLY FUN TOUCHES WITHIN THE MOVIE IS THAT TWO VAMPIRES IN OTHER SHOWS APPEAR IN THE MOVIE NOT AS VAMPIRES
VbQk4H8hgr0_14	NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO MOVES
atnd_PF-Lbs_15	THE TARDYION ONE MIGHT NOT SOUND ALL THAT YOU NEED
Af8D0E4ZXaw_25	IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH
dq3Nf_lMPnE_6	NOT A BAD IDEA FOR A SEQUEL
Nzq88NnDkEk_3	AND I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT I WAS
BI97DNYfe5I_16	AH THE ACTING WAS WAS PRETTY GOOD AND
BioHAh1qJAQ_16	THE MINUTE THE SAPLING ENTERS THE GREAT HEAVES PUT IN THE GAMES
bOL9jKpeJRs_10	BECAUSE HE WAS PROTECTING OVER HIS FAMILY AND AFTER THEY WENT THE SAYING OF ANOTHER THE END OF OUTSIDERS THEY HAVE ALL THESE POWERS
jUzDDGyPkXU_8	BUT NEVERTHELESS I KNOW A REALLY QUEER THING ABOUT THIS
dq3Nf_lMPnE_10	AND ALSO THE CUTE WINKS TO POP CULTURE
cW1FSBF59ik_12	AFTER HE BUSTLES CAPS IN THE AIR AND LANDS AND ALL THE DEAD BODIES FOLLOW HIM OH THINKS HE
fvVhgmXxadc_11	AND MANY A TIME SHE GOES LIKE A WHIRLWIND TWO BATTLE FIELD A CASTLE IS CANNA PULLED OUT O THE RINGS
8OtFthrtaJM_1	WHICH IS WHERE ALL GREAT RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD STARVE
Oz06ZWiO20M_6	AND PUNCH IS A FAILURE BUT LIKE A REALLY AMBITIOUS WEIRD INTERESTING IDIOSYNCRATIC FAILURE
phBUpBr1hSo_21	I MAY BE ON PAR WITH THE SECOND ONE MAY BE A LITTLE BEHIND THAT BUT IT WAS THAT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD STORY
OtBXNcAL_lE_13	I DON'T CARE FOR BASICALLY ANY OF IT BECAUSE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_3	AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
cXypl4FnoZo_15	UM WE HAD LIKE WE HAD GUESSED EVERYBODY UM IS LIKE THIS RANDOM CHARACTER DUDE WHO WHAT DOES HE DO
9J25DZhivz8_16	THERE IS ONE SCENE IN THIS RUBY THAT MAKES THREE D ENTIRELY WORTH IT
8qrpnFRGt2A_4	AND DOWN I ER PRETTY MUCH YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH MET MY LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MOST PART
1iG0909rllw_28	AND I THINK THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING BIT OF THE ENTIRE FILM
G6GlGvlkxAQ_2	I WOULD COUNT GUY CAPTAIN
yDtzw_Y-7RU_12	JUST REALLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO US TODAY AT ALL
9qR7uwkblbs_14	AND I WAS REALLY SET ABOUT IT
VbQk4H8hgr0_35	BUT DIDN'T EVEN GIVE HIM SO MUCH TO DO THAT HE HAD ONLY A FEW MINOR LINES
tIrG4oNLFzE_11	LIKE A GRUMPY LOOK AND THEN MAYBE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS HAPPY THAT SHE WOULDN'T FROWN HER AND ROUND HER EYEBROWSING BUT SHE'D STILL BE HAPPY YES LIKE THAT
d6hH302o4v8_30	ANNE WAS AWFUL
BvYR0L6f2Ig_7	N BY THE SOUND OF THE BRUSH PLOT THAT YOU MAY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY I I DIDN'T
Oz06ZWiO20M_21	I'M AND THAT'S WHAT TRADITIONAL NARRATIVE MOVIES DO
BXuRRbG0Ugk_21	IN A MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS DANIEL CRAIG STEALS THE WHOLE DANG SHO
c7UH_rxdZv4_1	OH MY GOSH BAD MOVIE
c7UH_rxdZv4_9	AND UNLIKE OTHER FILMS WERE THE KIND OF ANARCHISTIC FAT BOY BUT THEY BRING SOMETHING TO THE TABLE YOU KNOW
BvYR0L6f2Ig_15	AND NOW THEY DISSECT ME TO LEARN ACTING BETTER
Oz06ZWiO20M_2	UM AND IT IS JUST LIKE A WOMAN SAYING IT IS BAD
atnd_PF-Lbs_12	PLEASE RESIST FROM THESE TWO
wMbj6ajWbic_17	AND DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS AND
7JsX8y1ysxY_4	SO HE'S PRETTY FUNNY
Bfr499ggo-0_21	THE STORY LYING ISN'T IT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_35	MAN TO MAN IT REALLY LEFT THE DOOR OPEN
BvYR0L6f2Ig_13	FOR THE REST THE AXE WAS SO WOODEN
W8NXH0Djyww_14	HE DID A WONDERFUL JOB
VbQk4H8hgr0_27	ON YOUR OWN DON JOSE
2WGyTLYerpo_26	IT WAS REALLY CRUEL WHEN THEY DID THAT
Jkswaaud0hk_20	THEM'S ARE
bOL9jKpeJRs_21	AND RULES AND I AND I WHEN I WANTED TO WALK WITH HER I PICKED IT UP AND I BROUGHT IT HOME AND GOT REALLY DISAPPOINTED
k5Y_838nuGo_9	A WHICH ACTUALLY WAS REALLY GOOD
f9O3YtZ2VfI_16	THIS ALSO FALLS INTO THE TREND IT IS VERY PROPER IN THESE DAYS TO DO O C A I
f9O3YtZ2VfI_24	BUT IT'S IT'S LIKE SOME ONE MADE YOU A KICK AS SANDWICH BUT THEY'VE PUT MAN'S ON IT AND YOU DON'T LIKE MAN'S AND IT'S NOT LIKE TOMATO OR LETTUCE WHERE YOU CAN PICK IT OFF NO IT'S GOT ITS MAN'S AND IT'S ALL OVER THAT AND NOW YOU'S STOPPED WITH THIS KICK AS SANDWICH THAT WOULD BE KICKS IF IT DID NOT MAN'S ON IT BUT AS MAN'S ON IT OR YOU GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH
Nzq88NnDkEk_14	IT WAS CAUSE I WAS A KID BACK AT THE DAY BUT MEDUS WAS A LOTTSKY THAT SKURRIED THEN
zhpQhgha_KU_20	BECAUSE OF A LOT OF FISH IN IT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_26	I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE I REALLY SHOULD BEGIN WHEN LISTING OFF THE NEGATIVES BUT I'M GOING TO START WITH A FEW OF THE SUPERFICIAL THINGS
aiEXnCPZubE_11	THE HITS INCLUDED OSCAR ISAAC AS THE MAIN FELL IN LIKE I SAID BLUE JEM ALONE IS THE SOFT SPOKEN ROCKET AND THE SHOWS STEALING AT THE CORNERS OF SWEET PEA A TROUBLED AND RELUCTANT YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PACK
2WGyTLYerpo_33	IS REALLY REALLY HARD FOR IT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_14	THE GREAT EDITIONS
Ci-AH39fi3Y_4	SO I WAS IN A REALLY HUMPED UP
tmZoasNr4rU_16	I FEEL THAT THE MOVIE WASN'T REALLY CONCERNED WITH BEING EXCITING
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_20	CAN APPRECIATE THAT
HEsqda8_d0Q_28	I THINK IT'S ON MY BACK
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_17	I DON'T THINK IT'S AS BAD AS YOU'VE PROBABLY READ ON REVIEWS
WKA5OygbEKI_6	I'M IT'S NOT HIS BEST
9c67fiY0wGQ_10	PARENTS WILL FIND THEMSELVES LAUGHING AS THEY REMINISCED THEIR CHILDHOOD
IumbAb8q2dM_4	AH I SUGGEST THAT YOU GUYS GO AND WATCH THIS MORNING
Iu2PFX3z_1s_16	AND SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE TO COMPARE IT TO
Ci-AH39fi3Y_2	SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS BUT I WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT SO FIVE LOOK AT ALL
OQvJTdtJ2H4_11	LET'S DOWN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
2WGyTLYerpo_34	DON'T TAKE AWAY FROM ANYBODY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_15	YET HE'S A COMPETENT ACTION DIRECTOR
WKA5OygbEKI_5	AND I PRETTY MUCH WILL GO SEE ANY MOVIE THAT KIND OF HAS AN INTERESTING PLOT IF HE'S IN IT JUST
yDtzw_Y-7RU_9	ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS IN ITS DEVOTION IS THAT SOMETIMES MY CHILDREN COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS BEING SAID BECAUSE THEY WERE SPEAKING DICKENS SO MANY IN ENGLISH
vvZ4IcEtiZc_9	THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S SO MANY DYNAMICS GOING ON WITH THIS RELATIONSHIP AND I THINK THAT IT WAS IT WAS A GREAT STORY
wMbj6ajWbic_2	AND I FIRST OF ALL I ACTUALLY IT WAS NEVER A HUGE FAN OF THE GEOLOGICAL T V SERIES
iiK8YX8oH1E_1	ONE OF THOSE ROMANTIC COMEDIES THAT WE ALL DREAD
Jkswaaud0hk_18	YOU LADIES GO TOGETHER TO SEE IT TOGETHER SO
OtBXNcAL_lE_9	NOW I LIKE KATE HUDSON
Clx4VXItLTE_15	REALLY JUMPY MY FRIEND
lXPQBPVc5Cw_13	FOR SETTLING WITH THE NOMINALS
Oz06ZWiO20M_13	THINK IT'S REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE A MUSICAL AND ACT
I5y0__X72p0_31	THAT IS ORIGINAL
f_pcplsH_V0_11	I DON'T LIKE THE FIRST HOUR THAT MUCH THOUGH
1DmNV9C1hbY_5	BUT YOU KNOW FOR THIS ONE I JUST DIDN'T CARE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_7	FROM THE WAY OF ITS BEING RELEASED TO THE PERFORMANCES WITHIN IT TO THE STORY ITSELF IS ABSOLUTELY OVER THE TOP IMPRESSIVE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_9	GONE ARE THE WICKEDLY SATIRICAL SEND UPS OF THE WORLD OF FAIRY TALES
7JsX8y1ysxY_20	I TELL YOU WHO MADE THE RUBY
I5y0__X72p0_20	I WANTED TO BE THINKING THERE'S NO WAY
2WGyTLYerpo_63	AND I DEFTLY RECOMMEND YOU TO TAKE IT OUT IN THEATRES
8d-gEyoeBzc_26	IT PICKS UP SPEED AND NEVER LETS GO EVEN IN THE EVEN IN THE SCENES LIKE WHERE THEY THINK THEY'VE SLOWED AT IT IN OTHER MENTOR HAVE SOME DIALOGUE AND ER TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON YOU KNOW
d3_k5Xpfmik_19	THE STYLE OF THE FILM LIKE THE AIR THE FRIEZE FRAMES ARE SLO MOTION IN THE AIR THE JUNK COTS AND ALL THAT STUFF FEELS VERY KIND OF A TERRANTINE O S E
_dI--eQ6qVU_16	SURE IT'S FUN TO SEE HOW YOU'LL GO ROUND AND KICK THAT GUY BOUGHT IN NO PUNCH KICK WHATEVER BAM
rnaNMUZpvvg_19	KILLING THESE PEOPLE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IS GOING ON LIKE DO GET OVER YOURSELF
TvyZBvOMOTc_2	AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT
Clx4VXItLTE_14	M BUT REALLY GOOD LIKE
ob23OKe5a9Q_3	BECAUSE IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT THEY ARE
VCslbP0mgZI_13	I COULD KIND OF SEE THAT IN A SORT OF CHRIS ROCK DAVE CHAPEL WAY
jUzDDGyPkXU_6	IN FACT THIS MOVIE ISN'T EVEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DISTRICT NINE NOR IS IT A FOR A BLACK HAWK DOWN WHICH PEOPLE ARE COMPARED TO
MLal-t_vJPM_2	YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON
G6GlGvlkxAQ_1	I'LL PUT MONEY ON IT THAT IT IS GOING TO BE THE BLUFF FUSSER HEAD OF THE SUMMER IN TURNS WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE MOVIES
X3j2zQgwYgE_11	AND NOW I THINK
8OtFthrtaJM_21	JUST NOT ENOUGH DEPTH TO BE INTERESTING
_dI--eQ6qVU_25	I JUST LIKE IT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_16	DEFINITELY A LITTLE BIT ABOVE AVERAGE
v0zCBqDeKcE_6	THE REAL STEPHEN RUSSELL HAS LIKE AN IDEAL LIKE ONE SIXTY THREE WHICH IS LIKE WOW
8qrpnFRGt2A_16	THAT I WAS WATCHING ONE OF HIS ARMY OF ONE COMMERCIAL SOMETIMES
2WGyTLYerpo_36	HE'S IN ACCENTS PRETTY CONVINCING
phBUpBr1hSo_13	I'M UNASSURED ABOUT LUIS SO THAT'S FIVE
k5Y_838nuGo_24	IT DOES HAVE SOME I DON'T HEAR WHERE THERE IS A
Jkswaaud0hk_5	A FINE LIGHT WAY DATE MOVING
ZUXBRvtny7o_1	MY NIGHT IS DREAMING ALAS I AM NOT BEFORE YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THAT
nzpVDcQ0ywM_17	AND SO IT'S PRETTY ENTERTAINING
Iu2PFX3z_1s_8	NOW IT ISN'T A GREAT FANTASTIC TELEGRAPHY ABOUT A KIND OF MOVIE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_5	IT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF POTENTIALLY SETTING UP ALL THAT OTHER STUFF
f9O3YtZ2VfI_21	TO HIM MY FAVORITE ACTRESSES IN IT DON'T SWING AND CAPE BLANCHET
_dI--eQ6qVU_1	BUT I CAN SAFELY ASSURE YOU THAT EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T IT WOULD STILL BE A HIT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_8	ONLY THE ADDED ELEMENT OF KATRINA
1iG0909rllw_1	I THOUGHT THEY WERE AVERAGE
8qrpnFRGt2A_23	AND THERE'S A LOT OF IT
bOL9jKpeJRs_12	AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT IT IS A GOOD FAMILY
c7UH_rxdZv4_5	BASICALLY SETHRO AGAIN BROUGHT NONE OF THE CHARM THAT HE NORMALLY DOES TO HIS ROLLS AND
Iu2PFX3z_1s_5	I'M WHAT'S REALLY NEEDED ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THE CHEMICAL BROTHERS TO THE SOUND TRACKS WHAT'S POUNDING THE ENTIRE WAY THROUGH
c5xsKMxpXnc_4	WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MORNING WAS THE CONCEPT WAS COOL THERE
I5y0__X72p0_33	THE SOUND TRACK WAS INTERESTING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_2	BELIEVE THAT A SUCCESSFUL GREEN LANTERN MOVIE WOULD LEAD ONE OF OTHERS TO ADAPT THE FLASH AND WONDER WOMAN AMONG POSSIBLY OTHERS
rnaNMUZpvvg_11	EVERY SINGLE COWBOY WHICH IS A COMPLETE GOOSE BAG
_dI--eQ6qVU_6	IT WAS REALLY REALLY FUNNY
7JsX8y1ysxY_14	I'M POOH THE WHAT'S THAT WHAT WAS BAD WAS MILLY ACKERMAN THE GIRL PLACED THE SOLE SPECTRE TO MY JUNIOR
BioHAh1qJAQ_23	AND THE HOME HE BECOMES ABOUT THESE CRAZY AS I
Ci-AH39fi3Y_6	AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT WAS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN SO FOR NOT EXACTLY
9qR7uwkblbs_23	AND I WAS THINKING LIKE THAT IF I CAN BE MOTHER I'M A STONE AND CHRIS CAN BE GRIND COSTLY AND URGED TO BE GREAT DID YOU REALLY HAPPEN THIS WEEK
Vj1wYRQjB-o_4	WOULDN'T LOOK THAT POINT AT ME
8d-gEyoeBzc_7	I I DID ENJOY IT
HEsqda8_d0Q_14	IT'S TO NO ONE ELSE HE CAN'T
phBUpBr1hSo_2	BIG TRANSFORMERS FANNED
GWuJjcEuzt8_9	AND OVER ALL LOUISE CRIED ENTERTAINING THE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_7	GIVEN ALL THE STRIKES THAT HAD GOING THE INSTANT BEFORE WENT TO PRODUCTION IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH WORSE
G-xst2euQUc_17	BUT THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN MUCH THAT HAS COME OUT THIS YEAR SO FAR THAT I'VE BEEN DYING TO GO SEE
TvyZBvOMOTc_13	SOON TO BE REALLY ENJOYED THEMSELVES THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH
Njd1F0vZSm4_12	ANYWAY THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN SKIP
cW1FSBF59ik_10	I LOVE HIM AS AN ACTOR BASED ON HIS LOOKS AS A ACTUAL TALENTED ACTOR NO
phBUpBr1hSo_4	I'M I DON'T THINK THAT THIS ONE GOT AS MUCH BUZZ AND AS MUCH A IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND A WORD OF MOUTH YOU KNOW SPREADING AROUND AND STUFF
W8NXH0Djyww_2	ME I
2WGyTLYerpo_16	THERE IT'S A LOT OF FUN
aiEXnCPZubE_21	AND WHICH HURTS THE FILM DRASTICALLY
1iG0909rllw_5	BUT CYNATICALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD QUITE GOOD
c7UH_rxdZv4_16	IS BORING
k5Y_838nuGo_22	AH VIA THE FOURTH ONE IT DOES I GIVE YOU MY DEVIL
wMbj6ajWbic_12	AND QUITE HONESTLY I WISH I HAD SEEN US OVER THE SUMMER
Nzq88NnDkEk_16	BUT AM I JUST AS OLD ROY DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVING
X3j2zQgwYgE_7	I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BELIEVE THAT I NOW DON'T
Ci-AH39fi3Y_44	YOU KNOW I GUESS THE BALANCE IS OUT
ZUXBRvtny7o_18	THE GIRL HERSELF I AM SURE ARE LIKABLE
rnaNMUZpvvg_14	THEY GAVE HIM NO NO CHARACTER THAT HE HAD NO CARE TO DEVELOPMENT WHAT
pLTX3ipuDJI_15	IT DOESN'T GIVE ME ANY INSIGHT OR HELP IT JUST MAKES THEM SEEM LIKE SHE STARTED ON THE FIRST MOVE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_28	SO THAT MAKES SENSE
tStelxIAHjw_3	I REALLY DID
Af8D0E4ZXaw_17	AND I'M FINALLY A PARTICULAR STAND OUT FOR ME WAS THE FIGHTER JESSE QUINCY
2WGyTLYerpo_43	AND ALSO A OLIVIA WILD SHE'S PRETTY GOOD SHE'S BEAUTIFUL
9J25DZhivz8_18	THERE'S A ROLLER COASTER SEEN AND IF YOU ARE A GET A LITTLE BIT MOTION SAID YOU MIGHT NOT LET US SEE IT AND THREE BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ON THIS COASTER
I5y0__X72p0_23	IT DOESN'T HAVE A DEEP SEATED PLOT THERE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_7	TROM LEGACY IS A MOVIE WHERE ON MOST COUNTS THAT I JUDGE MOVIES IT KIND OF FAILS
tmZoasNr4rU_18	IMM
Ci-AH39fi3Y_20	BUT LUCKILY HOFFMAN'S STORY AH WAS IT REALLY REALLY REALLY AWESOME
VbQk4H8hgr0_28	IS NOT REALLY IN THAT WAY EVERY ONE
WKA5OygbEKI_8	WRANGLE KIND OF FALLS INTO THAT
bOL9jKpeJRs_31	AREN'T YOU N N
0h-zjBukYpk_6	STRANGE SINCE ONE OF MY BIGGEST GRAPES WITH THE EX MEN'S SERIES WAS AND ALWAYS IS THE CASIC NOW
1iG0909rllw_14	AND HOWEVER IT IS DISLOYALTY TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE THAT GIVES IT ITS FLAWS LIKE A
vyB00TXsimI_1	BUT I DO WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT PRIEST
5W7Z1C_fDaE_1	PROBABLY ONE OF THE BALSIEST FILMS OF SOME DANCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN
c7UH_rxdZv4_27	E'EN MA'AM THEY THE ONLY CHARACTER WHO ACTUALLY SHOWED THEIR MOTIVATIONS BY ANYTHING THEY DID WAS THE VILLAIN
I5y0__X72p0_39	WHICH IS CORPS
G6GlGvlkxAQ_13	AND YOU SAW US WITH THE EMPTY SEA RECENT FLAP OF THE CAPE WHICH WAS A SHOW I LOVED
Oz06ZWiO20M_12	AH AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S TRYING TO BE THAT
IumbAb8q2dM_2	IT'S A QUEER THING
nzpVDcQ0ywM_7	I HATE TO SAY THAT
c5xsKMxpXnc_12	THERE IS NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT REALLY WITH THESE TWO
POKffnXeBds_13	I JUST REALLY WASN'T GOOD
8qrpnFRGt2A_24	I MEAN THIS MOVING MAKE SIR MAKES THE STALWART GRIEFS
d3_k5Xpfmik_2	BASICALLY ER OH
jUzDDGyPkXU_2	ACTION IS REALLY REALLY WELL DIRECTED
W8NXH0Djyww_30	BUT THAT CAN REALLY MATTER
Ci-AH39fi3Y_25	BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE BEST PART OF SAW FIVE WAS THE STORY LINE LIKE IN GENERAL EVERYTHING
c5xsKMxpXnc_15	YOU DON'T SEE WHY THEY SHOULD LIKE EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY'RE SHORT OF THEM
_dI--eQ6qVU_23	THE GREENHORN TO SOMETHING SIMILAR
VbQk4H8hgr0_25	AND I DON'T SUGGEST ANY ONE WILL SEE
2iD-tVS8NPw_28	IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING TO SEE OH WHERE THEY GET TO BE GOIN WITH THEM
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_17	NOT IN ALL INSTANCES BUT THE ONES THAT MARRY THE MOST YEAH
rnaNMUZpvvg_4	BUT IT'S SUCH A WASTED MONEY FOR THEM LIKE WHEN I SEEMED TO BE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY I HAD A VERY GOOD BUDGET AND IT'S LIKE NOT EVEN GOOD IS THIS ANGRY SO JUSTLY WHY ARE YOU WASTING SO MUCH MY
5W7Z1C_fDaE_16	IT IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING
nbWiPyCm4g0_4	FUSSY LET ME JUST SAY I SAW QUITE A FEW GUYS AT THE CINEMA WHO CLEARLY BEEN DRAGGED THERE BY THE GIRL FRIENDS AND TO THOSE GUYS I SAY WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SEW YOUR BALLS BACK ON FOR YOU
f9O3YtZ2VfI_25	HE'S JUST NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH
73jzhE8R1TQ_11	BUT PRESENTLY IT WERE TOO HOLLYWOOD FOR ME
Ci-AH39fi3Y_5	AND EXCITED TO SEE IT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_41	I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE THINKING
7JsX8y1ysxY_13	THE RIGHTS WERE NOT IN THE NUDITY
k5Y_838nuGo_3	AND I HATCH OF IT I I LIKE YOU I DO
cM3Yna7AavY_14	I HAVE IT I'M ON THE WAY
Qr1Ca94K55A_10	I'M ONE OF THE BIG THINGS I WAS DISAPPOINTED THOUGH IT WAS I FELT THAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE A LOT MORE WITH THREE I THOUGHT
bOL9jKpeJRs_22	IT'S BECAUSE HE'S SUCH A FINE FELLOW
tIrG4oNLFzE_18	BUT THEN THOSE TWO MOMENTS GOT RUINED BY THE REST OF AN HOUR AND A HALF OF HER BEING HEALTHY
0h-zjBukYpk_23	NOW HE'S SEEN IN THE BEGINNING THAT REALLY SOLD ME
LSi-o-IrDMs_19	AND THE COLOUR LOOKED GREAT
X3j2zQgwYgE_5	BUT IT'S RINGING OUT WITH WONDERFUL NOTHING
d6hH302o4v8_32	IRRESOLUTE SCENE WITH SEDGY EYE WHO IS
yDtzw_Y-7RU_1	BUT LET ME FIRST SAY THIS I LIKED IT MORE THAN I EXPECTED I WOULD
d3_k5Xpfmik_10	IS BASICALLY A A SLOW MOTION SHOW CASE OF DIFFERENT EVENTS
yDtzw_Y-7RU_4	MY SOUL WAS TERRIFIED THROUGH PART OF THIS BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL VERSION IS TERRIFYING
_dI--eQ6qVU_24	IT TOOK A NEW SPAN ON IT AND
1iG0909rllw_30	AND THAT WAS REALLY BORING
lXPQBPVc5Cw_22	AND REALLY FUNNY AUNT ANIMATION THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT VERY FUNNY
9T9Hf74oK10_23	IT'S NOT LIKE A PERIOD PIECE OR ANYTHING
HEsqda8_d0Q_20	THEY HAD GENERALLY THE ACCENTS OF REALLY GOODS
Njd1F0vZSm4_9	AH MY OTHER COMPLAINT OTHER THAN THAT THERE'S NOTHING LIGHT OR FUNNY IN THE STORY TO BREAK UP THE SOMBRE MOOD IS THE BATTLE ITSELF
VbQk4H8hgr0_30	JUST AS THEY ARE WITH ALL THE OTHER SECRETS THAT ARE COMING OUT AND THIS
Jkswaaud0hk_17	I CERTAINLY CAN MORE OF A DATE LOUIS THAN OUR SEEING ALONE UNLESS
9J25DZhivz8_23	EVERY ONE CAN RELATE YOU AND I
OtBXNcAL_lE_23	UM AND IT'S REALLY UNPREDICTABLE
jUzDDGyPkXU_26	WELL I CAN'T SAY RIGHT NOW I REMEMBER THE NAMES OF ANY CHARACTERS NONE OF THEM WERE MEMORABLE AND
phBUpBr1hSo_8	AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE TOO MUCH TOO FAST I MEAN THAT THERE ARE TO TELL EACH OTHER THEY LOVE EACH OTHER AND TALK ABOUT GETTING WEDDING RINGS AND SPENDING THE REST THEY LIKED TOGETHER THEY LIVED TOGETHER I MEAN TO JUST WAIT TOO MUCH TOO FAST THEY TRIED TO PUT HARD INTO IT BY YOU KNOW HIM SAYING YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IN THIS WORLD YOU KNOW I DON'T CARE ABOUT MYSELF YOU DON'T THINK SHE THINKS HE'S DOING CRAZY SHE'S HIS LIFE AND THAT THEN HE DOES CRAZY STUFF TO SAVOUR AND HE'S LIKE I LOVE YOU AND YOU DON'T IT'S ALL THE SAPPY'S
8OtFthrtaJM_22	I HAVE TO SAY MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE AS OF THE CHARACTER THOMPSON
8OtFthrtaJM_10	I SHOULD GIVE A SHY YOU KNOW
QN9ZIUWUXsY_17	IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE I KNOW
nzpVDcQ0ywM_2	THE PLOT HAS THE CONSISTENCY OF SWISS CHEESE
Clx4VXItLTE_13	IT IS JUST SOMETIMES AS TO US A BIT LIKE OH GOD WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT CRINGE
LSi-o-IrDMs_26	WE'RE GOING TO GET BURNED OUT AS ASSISTANT AS A SOCIETY ONE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_11	WASN'T THERE IT
ZUXBRvtny7o_7	THE SOUND IS GOOD IT'S REALLY GOOD SOME REALLY GREAT SONGS
bvLlb-M3UXU_20	AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS SCENE TOOK PLACE FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN HE'S GUYS WHEN YOU'RE ABSOLUTE PRIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A ABSOLUTELY BREATH TAKING MONUMENTAL MOMENT IN SYMPHONIC HISTORY BUT
Clx4VXItLTE_21	THAT WAS THE ONE JUST SCREAMS IN
nzpVDcQ0ywM_6	IT WAS REALLY KIND OF COME DOWN FOR US
G6GlGvlkxAQ_10	I AGREE WITH YOU ALL RIGHT
7JsX8y1ysxY_8	WHAT WAS WEIRD WAS THE FACT THAT IN PART OF THE RUBY HE'S WEARING LIKE A BLUE A O'ER ALL ONE THING MEDDLE THONG THING SO'S I'VE WENT OUT WEAR IT ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW WHY WHY YOU GOT A NEW COMMAND ON US
d6hH302o4v8_38	DO NOT SEE THIS MOVING
IumbAb8q2dM_12	AH IT'S MORE DETAILS SO I CAN'T GET MY HANDS ON IT NOW
BI97DNYfe5I_30	I'M FROM AT THE END
rnaNMUZpvvg_20	HE LOOKED OFF SOME WHILE HE DID IT BUT YES OF COURSE I LIKE ALL THE GIRLS WHO WENT ALL DISAGREED WITH ME THAT HE DOESN'T AMAZINGLY BUT THEY DON'T THINK IT WAS MAISIE BECAUSE THEY WERE STARING AT DAY AND I CRIED THE WHOLE TIME I'M GOING ON THE GRASS SHE'S SO HOT
v0zCBqDeKcE_10	YOUR HAPPINESS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITES
rnaNMUZpvvg_10	EVEN HE WAS PRODUCED BY ALL OF THEM
d6hH302o4v8_23	AND THIS IS THE WORST BY FAR
POKffnXeBds_5	I MEAN THE MORE HE REALLY WASN'T FUNNY AT ALL
I5y0__X72p0_38	THE MUSIC HAD A DRIBBLE OF THE ACTION
k5Y_838nuGo_13	AND IF JESS WAS BETTER MAYBE AS THE BABE
WKA5OygbEKI_18	AND I I WOULD I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS
Iu2PFX3z_1s_1	THIS IS HIS MOST ENGAGING ENDEAVOR YET
zhpQhgha_KU_16	I THINK THAT CHARLOTTE AND MIRANDA HAVE SOME REALLY NICE MOMENTS IN THE RUBY
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_2	THE TRAILERS WON'T REALLY DOING IT MUCH FOR ME
d3_k5Xpfmik_8	BUT HE'S REALLY WELL DONE
PZ-lDQFboO8_10	LOVED THE SHREDDED FILMS AND
c5xsKMxpXnc_9	YOU DON'T FEEL THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER AND
yDtzw_Y-7RU_13	ALL THE STUFF ABOUT THEATRES PRISON FOR INSTANCE DOESN'T REALLY OF JIBE HERE IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AMERICA
tIrG4oNLFzE_15	SO I REALLY THINK ESPECIALLY AFTER MY LEAD AND ROLE YOU REALLY SHOULD PREPARE FOR THAT ROLE I WAS
HEsqda8_d0Q_25	I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OUR PEOPLE IT'S TRUE
9T9Hf74oK10_14	IN EVERYTHING SHE DOES SHE HAS SO MUCH GRACE TO IT IN SO MUCH FLUIDITY
VbQk4H8hgr0_43	REALLY I THINK I SHOULD HAVE JUST WALKED UP AND LEFT IT THAT MOMENT
BI97DNYfe5I_22	IT IS FUNNY IT'S A FUNNY MOVIE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_13	WE DID NOT NEED THE ENTIRE EXPANSE BURNT TO DEATH
k5Y_838nuGo_27	ABOUT A WAFFLE HOLE AND BY THE ALONE I'M I'VE HEARD IT ENOUGH TO THINK THAT SOME DIRTY AS IT TOTALLY DOES WAFFLE HOLE
wMbj6ajWbic_18	YOU KNOW THE THIRD INN UNDER IT IT IS THIS IS A CHEESEY AND MOVING
W8NXH0Djyww_18	THIS WAS ALL THIS ONE REALLY COOL ACTION SEQUENCES WHERE I LIKE THIS RANEE A JOHNNIE THAT'S POSSE THEY WERE GETTING CHASED BY ALL THESE LIKE POSSUMS OR
Clx4VXItLTE_4	ADORNED EXACTLY AND SCARED
BI97DNYfe5I_6	TO ME THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD MOODY
fvVhgmXxadc_5	PRETTY HEAVILY HAMPERED IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_12	AS WELL AS IF YOU DID NOT WORK FOR ME AT THEE
G-xst2euQUc_19	I WAS THOROUGHLY SURPRISED
TvyZBvOMOTc_11	A LITTLE'S MOVIE BRINGS A CUTE LAUGH HERE AND THERE
ZUXBRvtny7o_22	I HAVE REALLY THIS MORNING
Nzq88NnDkEk_13	I THOUGHT I MIGHT DO SO REALLY WASN'T THAT SCARY
cW1FSBF59ik_11	HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T FEEL THE BILL EITHER FOR ANY PROBABLY A ZERO
wMbj6ajWbic_27	I'M I'M FRISK FOR APPLES
BXuRRbG0Ugk_8	FORTUNATELY SOME GOOD DECISIONS WERE MADE BEFORE THE CAMERA STARTED ROLLING JOHN
Clx4VXItLTE_26	COULD FEEL THE SEED JUMP IN AND THEN
cM3Yna7AavY_15	OH I COULDN'T EVEN WATCH IT
phBUpBr1hSo_11	I LOVE MY MOVIES TO BE LONG
9T9Hf74oK10_25	AND I THINK EARLY ON THE TWIST IS REVEALED
2WGyTLYerpo_58	A HUGE FLAW BUT IT'S THERE AND IT'S NOTICEABLE OVER ALL
yDtzw_Y-7RU_18	ALSO ABOUT THE ANIMATION OF THE PEOPLE JUST LIKE AN POLAR EXPRESS A FILM I REALLY DID NOT LIKE
2WGyTLYerpo_27	THE ALIENS WERE REALLY COOL LOOKING
fvVhgmXxadc_2	BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS AN UGLY LOUD VIOLENT UNVOLVING AND STATISTIC EXERCISE THAT
bvLlb-M3UXU_23	THE FINAL ALL YOU'LL FINALLY HAPPENED YOU'RE UNITING THAT WE ALL COME TO EXPECT
W8NXH0Djyww_10	AND THEY ALL PLAYED OUT FOR EACH OTHER THERE
bvLlb-M3UXU_9	THIS MOVING ESSENTIALLY WAS MADE FOR THREE REASONS IN MY OPINION
ZUXBRvtny7o_12	LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE IT STARTS WITH REALLY GREAT ACTUAL CONSEQUENCES
Ci-AH39fi3Y_31	SHE'S STILL GOOD BECAUSE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_5	AND THAT DESCRIBES COWBOYS AND ALIENS PRETTY WELL
Oz06ZWiO20M_9	NOT BAD IN THE WAY I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE BAD
7JsX8y1ysxY_35	I'LL WARN YOU IT'S VERY VERY DARK
fvVhgmXxadc_3	AND VERY LITTLE JOY OUT OF
9J25DZhivz8_5	THE VISUALS WERE GREAT
rnaNMUZpvvg_15	HOWEVER HE WAS JUST LIKE A PLOT DEVICE FOR THIS OTHER GUIDE TO START ACTING LIKE A FATHER'S FIGURE AND IT WAS STUPID BUT THAT HE DIDN'T EVEN ACT THE FIGURE TOWARDS HIM HE
Jkswaaud0hk_6	I THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE GOING TO ENJOY THIS MORE THAN THE GUISE AH CERTAINLY DO
OtBXNcAL_lE_8	BUT YOU KNOW WHY I TOOK A CHANCE
tIrG4oNLFzE_4	REALLY DID ENJOY AS WELL WASN'T SHE FOND OF THE INDIAN BUT
bvLlb-M3UXU_14	AH I GOT YOU CREDIT
d6hH302o4v8_40	DOME
QN9ZIUWUXsY_5	BUT I WAS STILL RIDICULOUSLY ENTERTAINED BY IT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_24	I DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE
cW1FSBF59ik_4	I LOVE WHEN THEY SHOW ALL THAT THE WORST OF THE KIND HAS BEEN THE MILITARY
etzxEpPuc6I_6	THEY HAVE A LOT OF ADULT SITUATIONS IN IT
8d-gEyoeBzc_11	AND I LIKED SIR ADRIAN BRODIE'S CHARACTER
2WGyTLYerpo_13	THIS IS REALLY INTENSE ACTION SEEMS ESPECIALLY THE SAME WHEN THE ALIENS FIRST INVADED THAT
BioHAh1qJAQ_10	GETS STRAIGHT INTO THE STORY
1DmNV9C1hbY_1	THERE'S ONE I DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT
dq3Nf_lMPnE_14	UNLESS YOUR KIDS ARE DARING TO SEE IT I'LL WAIT FOR THE DEVI D I GIVE
73jzhE8R1TQ_7	SO I LET THE RUBY BE CUT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_1	WELL WHAT ARE THE NAMES FOR ALL
9c67fiY0wGQ_3	I THINK THAT MAY BE REALLY DEPICTED THE LIVELINESS OF NEW YORK CITY WELL SINCE I'M A NEW YORKER MYSELF
bvLlb-M3UXU_8	IS A BAD GUY GOD GO TAKE HIM OUT THAT'S REALLY ALL YOU NEED
Ci-AH39fi3Y_14	CONSORT TO POOH A M
VbQk4H8hgr0_1	AND THIS IS ONE THAT I CAN SAY I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED
IumbAb8q2dM_15	AND HE WERE A GOOD BOOK
W8NXH0Djyww_9	ALL THE ANIMALS WHICH IS SO FUNNY
Nzq88NnDkEk_5	AND I WAS GOING TO BE GOOD
ob23OKe5a9Q_1	BUT IT WAS THE RUBY
W8NXH0Djyww_15	ALL THE SIN OF PHOTOGRAPHY IN THIS MOVING WAS GREATLY
BvYR0L6f2Ig_26	YOU KNOW SHE'S GOING TO DISTRESS AND YOU FEEL SORRY FOR YOU WANT TO HELP HER
8d-gEyoeBzc_21	THE OTHER ONES ARE UNFORTUNATELY AND I THINK IN THE WRITING SOMEWHERE THEY'RE JUST ONE I'VE DEVELOPED ENOUGH FEED TO CARE ABOUT THEM I'M AND INCLUDES AS IT TOWED FOR GRACE NOTHING IN HIS NAME OR THE ENCLOSED HIS CHARACTER ER
OtBXNcAL_lE_21	MEAN YOU CAN GO SEE IT AYE PERSONALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT BECAUSE
BI97DNYfe5I_28	BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD AN GET IT
W8NXH0Djyww_4	AND THIS TOWN IS LIKE FROM A GOOD OLD WESTERNER
cXypl4FnoZo_17	HE'S JUST LIKE THIS THIS CHARACTER WHOSE CANANDUM AND
rnaNMUZpvvg_21	ALL THE GUYS I WENT WITH WERE PRETTY MUCH ON MY PAGE THERE IT IS LIKE WELL THAT WAS STUPID WELL
ZUXBRvtny7o_8	AND THE BEST THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT ALL THOSE SONGS AH WELL NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF THE SONGS ARE NOT WELL CONNECTED WITH THE SCENES
VbQk4H8hgr0_39	BUT I FOUND IT POINTLESS IN THE END OF THE MOVIE
LSi-o-IrDMs_14	UM M BUTTAH THIS THREE DEPUTY LOOKS A LOT BETTER I THINK THAN REALLY
OtBXNcAL_lE_6	JUST DIFFERENT JUST TO OTHER PEOPLE PLAYING THE ROLLS
2iD-tVS8NPw_3	ENJOYED IT FOR WHAT IT WAS YOU KNOW IT
0h-zjBukYpk_15	BUT IT IS REALLY SO EXPLANATORY
f9O3YtZ2VfI_19	THAT'S A LOOK TOO TOO GOOD
BI97DNYfe5I_19	BECAUSE TAKE A BUNCH OF YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU'LL YOU DAZZLE HAVE A GOOD TIME YOU'LL HAVE
bOL9jKpeJRs_1	AND I WAS UNMISTAKABLY HOW MUCH I LOVED
yDtzw_Y-7RU_11	THEREFORE ALLOW THE SOCIAL COMMENTARY OF THOSE WHIP OVER YOUR HEAD
BvYR0L6f2Ig_3	BUT THE SECOND ONE IT DID IN SOME WAYS TAKE TO THE NEXT LITTLE BOAT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_7	SO IF THAT'S A FORM OF CHRISTIANITY IT'S A CHRISTIAN SHOW
bOL9jKpeJRs_7	NOT A DOUBT OF THAT
W8NXH0Djyww_19	NOW WHAT'S THEY POSSUMS BUT PRAIRIE DOGS
OQvJTdtJ2H4_13	BUT THE SEA WAS GREAT AND
GWuJjcEuzt8_17	YOU KNOW PROBABLY IN THE MIDDLE TO TWO POINT FIVE STARS AND
9T9Hf74oK10_1	AS IF I CAN MOVE YOU
d6hH302o4v8_35	HE'S IN A THEATER WE'RE LAUGHING HOW BAD WE WAS AT SOME POINTS
I5y0__X72p0_7	I GOTTA SAY I WASN'T BLOWN AWAY BY
atnd_PF-Lbs_9	NOW I WON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT ACTING BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO BAD
dq3Nf_lMPnE_13	IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE GREAT CHARACTERS OF SHRUG AND HIS SUPPORTING CAST WHO ARE STILL VOICED BY THE ORIGINAL STARS LIKE MIRES AT A MURPHY CAMERON DIAZ AND ANTONIO BANDANAS THE FILM WOULD BE A REAL BUST
_dI--eQ6qVU_19	MIXED IT MORE USUALLY PEELING AND
6_0THN4chvY_12	SO AH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ONE OF THE POOLS AND DO YOU LIKE FAMILY FILMS GO SEE IT
GWuJjcEuzt8_4	AND YOU KNOW IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHO ELSE YOU KNOW IN THE INDUSTRY NOWADAYS HAS THE VOICE LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW IT'S
HEsqda8_d0Q_31	I CAN IMAGINE GETTING THIS READY AND WATCHING IT AT CHRISTMAS TIME BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL SO LIKE IT'S NOT ABOUT COMMERCIALISATION IT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW FAMILIES BEING TOGETHER
BI97DNYfe5I_13	I'M HE WAS GOOD HE
9c67fiY0wGQ_9	IT IS A FUN FAMILY FILM
ZUXBRvtny7o_26	I WILL EVEN BE KEPTISMABLY ON GLORY I AM ANYWAYS I AM DEMOCRAT FOR ME IS THREE STARS OUT OF FIVE STARS THREE SOLID STARS
8d-gEyoeBzc_29	I DID REALLY FEEL AND THE CONCLUSION OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NECESSARY
k5Y_838nuGo_20	ONE IS MORE KIDDING WITH THOSE
zhpQhgha_KU_29	BUT ALL IN ALL WASN'T REALLY THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN
tmZoasNr4rU_9	IT'S PROBABLY WHAT I HELPED IF I WENT WHIFF OF SOME ONE I'VE ALWAYS ONE OF ONE OF THE PERSONS WELL WITH ME
8OtFthrtaJM_9	BUT I MUST SAY THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY BIG SHOES TO FILL SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IT HAS A CHANCE I
zhpQhgha_KU_21	YOU REALLY CAN KIND OF SYMPATHIZE WELL I GUESS YOU HAVE KIDS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_19	I WAS REALLY WELL PUT TOGETHER
aiEXnCPZubE_19	THEY COULD HAVE GREAT BAXTERS BUT
Jkswaaud0hk_15	BUT ALL I THOUGHT WAS IT IS A FINE PICTURE AND I
vyB00TXsimI_11	WHICH BASICALLY MEANS HE'S FORMED TONGUE AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT WAY
Sqr0AcuoNnk_12	HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS EVER
Njd1F0vZSm4_13	WHERE YOU CAN SEE UP TO YOU
d6hH302o4v8_31	I WAS I SPEAK TO YOU THAT'S HOW I WILL BE THAT
LSi-o-IrDMs_24	I LOVE THAT
Qr1Ca94K55A_5	AND HIS ACTING WAS REALLY GOOD NOT MOODY BUT
ZUXBRvtny7o_4	I WAS HAPPY TO SEE IT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_2	THIS FILM IS SLAVISHLY DEVOTED TO THE ORIGINAL BOOK OR NOVELLA BY CHARLES DICKENS
Bfr499ggo-0_6	FOR A FEW TIMES I DO LIKE THE FASHION
8OtFthrtaJM_3	LILY SAID OUT LOUD WHAT KAY WHAT IS THIS MOVING THAT I AM SEEING WHAT IS THIS
Qr1Ca94K55A_1	THIS MOVING IS JUST RIDICULOUS AND I I THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_30	ACTING IS NOT THAT BAD BUT
2WGyTLYerpo_24	AND ALSO I LIKE HOW IT'S KIND OF UP SHOWED THEM TO US INSTEAD OF HIDING THEM LIKE SHOWING A LITTLE LIKE AN ARM UNSEEN OR SOMETHING NO THEY'D JUST LIKE STRAYED UP SHOW IT TO US AND I WOULD
c5xsKMxpXnc_13	IF THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE CHARACTERS TO FIND BUT NONE WHERE THESE TWO SHOULD BE TOGETHER THERE
WKA5OygbEKI_14	AH HE SUPERINTENDING AS THE CHAMELEON
etzxEpPuc6I_16	WHY THE MOON HE WAS WHILE I WAS RIDICULOUSLY TERRIBLE LIKE
Vj1wYRQjB-o_6	LIKE I SAID I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS GREAT
Jkswaaud0hk_10	I WAS SURPRISED AH THE AMOUNT OF SKIN THEY SHOWED
pLTX3ipuDJI_4	IN THE FIRST ONE THERE ARE TWO AND THEY WORK TOGETHER AND YOU SEE THE PERSONALITIES THIS MAY BE JUST POPS THE GROUP OF DIFFERENT COLOURS DOWN TOGETHER AND LETS THEM INTERACT POORLY
G6GlGvlkxAQ_4	I THINK THORN REALLY CAN DO WHAT
Nzq88NnDkEk_11	IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS NO STORY DEVELOPMENT IN IT
ZUXBRvtny7o_33	COST IT TO WORK IT
2iD-tVS8NPw_19	AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO GO THAT ROW BUT OH
aiEXnCPZubE_9	AND IT IS UPSTAGED BY MANY OTHER PERFORMANCES IN THE FILM
1iG0909rllw_7	TO KEEP ON HEARING THAT CHRIS WHITE'S WAS GOING TO DIRECTLY MEAN BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT WAS FOR THE WOMAN'S THE GOLD COMPASS
Clx4VXItLTE_12	THAT'S LIKE ALL MOVIES IT'S TO SAY WHEN'S A BAD CUSTOMER
v0zCBqDeKcE_9	I THINK THEY'RE VERY GOOD ACTORS YOU ARE
VCslbP0mgZI_5	AND HERE'S WHY YES THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH THIS NO ONE TO TALK ABOUT EM BUT YOU KNOW IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
8qrpnFRGt2A_26	NAPLES AS FAR AS I JUST SEED YE I HAVE EE LIKE THOSE TIMES WHEN THERE'S LIKE A HUMAN FACE AND EVERYTHING AROUND THE FACE IS CARTOON C G I A PEWTER OF FACTS
03bSnISJMiM_4	BUT NOT ON THE WHOLE THEY SHOULD HAVE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_18	THIS LOOKS LIKE IT JUST HAS A POLY EUROPEAN COATING ON IT
c5xsKMxpXnc_5	BUT THEY DID NOT EXECUTE IT VERY WELL AND
7JsX8y1ysxY_5	PEOPLE WERE LIKE E POP CORN AND NOW YOU SEE THE FIRST SHOCK OF A MAN'LL BE BUT YOU'VE HERE LIKE US THIS RIPPLE EFFECT OF WHISPERINGS OH MY DOT IS THAT ALL IS IT AM I LOOKING THIS WAY WHAT
nbWiPyCm4g0_9	I DON'T KNOW CHARLOTTE'S STORY I MADE ME NEVER WANT TO HAVE KIDS OR NEVER WANT TO HAVE RICH FRIENDS
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_7	MY GOD OH IF WE HAD REALLY TRIED DIALOGUE
W8NXH0Djyww_24	I'M BUT THIS MOVING IT HAD EVERYTHING HUMAN ROMANCE FOR ACTION
rnaNMUZpvvg_8	ALL THE CHARACTERS WHICH IS SO AND THE
03bSnISJMiM_2	THEY DID IT THEY DIDN'T REALLY DO IT HE VENTURED IN VAIN AND WHY SHE HAS TO FIGHT AND BE PREPARED
BXuRRbG0Ugk_18	AND THE ACTION WASN'T THE MOST MEMORABLE THING ABOUT ANY OF THOSE MEN
tStelxIAHjw_14	GUESS I'M JUST OVER IT
k5Y_838nuGo_31	OR MY COUSINS DOESN'T LIKE THE GLASSES
0h-zjBukYpk_19	NOW THE PERFORMANCES ON BORDER LINE O CAIRN
ZAIRrfG22O0_5	THE MOVIE THEATER GAVE ME CREDIT TO A FUTURE MOVING SO THAT I APPRECIATED
d6hH302o4v8_7	WHERE'S THAT SCREAM OUT OF THE PUNCH IN THE FACE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_43	I SAID I LOVED THE HOFFMAN'S STORY LINE SO
BI97DNYfe5I_11	AND ALL THE ACTION SCENES WERE GREAT
IumbAb8q2dM_16	I'M AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO COME OUT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_17	MY LITTLE ONES SAID I LIKE THIS SHE IS A TERRIFIC SHE'S NICE LOOKS
G6GlGvlkxAQ_16	I'LL WHEN YOU GET TO SITS AND THEN TURNS THE COMIC BOOKS AND COME UP AND MOVES IT TAKES A WHILE FOR THE FELT THAT
pLTX3ipuDJI_7	BUT NOTHING SUCKS EITHER WHICH GAINS THE RUBIES AND POINTS TO US
BvYR0L6f2Ig_24	DISPLACED INTO THE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS OF OUR CHARACTERS SO WELL
I5y0__X72p0_13	ANYWAYS IT'S SKIPPING PAST THAT SHE'S GOT THIS LIKE KICKET ATTITUDE
HEsqda8_d0Q_1	AS A MAN SAY YOU
Qr1Ca94K55A_7	WHATEVER SO I'M NOT SAYING THIS MOVIE'S BAD BECAUSE IT'S NOT
cM3Yna7AavY_11	A LIVELY LOWED STITCH
nzpVDcQ0ywM_18	THIS IS A REALLY BIG MOVIE FOR THEIR CAREERS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THEM IN A LOT OF BIG MOVIES AND OTHERS
Ci-AH39fi3Y_37	BUT LIKE A SEED THE A PLOT OF HOFFMAN THAN THAT WAS REALLY REALLY ALSO
BI97DNYfe5I_25	IT'S ONE IT'S ONE TO CHECK OUT THE OTHERS I WOULD SAY
9T9Hf74oK10_7	THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERE ARE CRITICS OF MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES TOO THOUGHTFUL IN A WAY AND I THINK THAT WILL NEVER LET ME GO
7JsX8y1ysxY_33	IT'S VERY VERY INTERESTING
7JsX8y1ysxY_29	ARE REALLY LIKE A SICKER GUY WITH
Bfr499ggo-0_17	AND THE ALMS IT WAS A BUNCH OF THE OLD FRIENDS AGAIN THOUGH
BvYR0L6f2Ig_11	I DID LIKE THE SECOND ONE
0h-zjBukYpk_5	AND BEFORE WE GO ON WITH THAT I MUST SAY THAT THIS HAD A SURPRISINGLY DECENT CAST
QN9ZIUWUXsY_12	BASICALLY A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT I COULD TAKE A MOVE ON IT'S REALLY WOBBLY
Clx4VXItLTE_20	AND I WOULD GO UP AGAIN TO SEE IT BECAUSE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_1	COWBOYS AND ALIENS METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE ENNA FELL TEAMS THAT HAS THE TALENT TO BE A SUPERABLE CHAMPION BUT INSTEAD OF BEING A WILD CARD TEAM THAT GETS DISMISSED IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE PLAY OFFS
BI97DNYfe5I_7	AND ON BECAUSE OF THAT I WAS EXPECTING SOUTH ROAN TILL IT MAY BE TRIED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS BUT HE WASN'T BUT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_16	PERFECT FOR THAT RULE
cXypl4FnoZo_7	AND SHE WAS GOING AWAY DURING THE TWILIGHT
c7UH_rxdZv4_26	NOTHING THAT'S WORTH GOING TO THEATRES TO SEE
_dI--eQ6qVU_27	I KNOW IF I WAS WEARING THREE GLASSES AND WAS SEEING THIS AND THREE I WOULD ENJOY IT A LOT MORE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_10	BUT I THINK IT'S ONE DOESN'T KNOW IT'S SO UNIQUE
I5y0__X72p0_9	IT WAS GOOD
LSi-o-IrDMs_11	BUT NONE OF THOSE THINGS MATTER IT'S A FUN MOVING ANYWAY
ob23OKe5a9Q_4	IT'S A WOMAN'S
HEsqda8_d0Q_32	I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU CALL FORE AND AFTER
G-xst2euQUc_14	NO IDEA THAT ANNE HATHAWAY COULD REALLY SING IF
2WGyTLYerpo_10	AND IN SATISFACTORY THE
yDtzw_Y-7RU_5	LET US IN THIS IF YOUR CHRISTIANITY IS EXTREMELY LEGALISTIC THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU
1DmNV9C1hbY_13	BUT OTHERWISE I KNOW
6Egk_28TtTM_2	AND MY FAVOURITE CARES ON THE RUBY WOULD HAVE TO BE MY LOVE MY LOVE'S MOTHER AND GOOD
9J25DZhivz8_3	THERE WERE SOME REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE
2iD-tVS8NPw_14	YOU KNOW GOING INTO IT OR AT LEAST WATCHING THE TRAILERS BEFORE IT I WAS REALLY A KIND OF HESITANT ABOUT SEEING THE GREEN LANTERN IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE
Jkswaaud0hk_14	STORY LYON WAS O K
2iD-tVS8NPw_8	THAT'S REALLY GOOD
9J25DZhivz8_21	THERE'S A GREAT EFFECT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_24	IS PERFECT FROM START TO FINISH HARRIS
7JsX8y1ysxY_38	AND SO AT THE END THERE'S NOT REALLY A WHOLE LOT OF REDEEMING VALUE THAT I THINK YOU COME UP WITH
2WGyTLYerpo_38	IT GIVES AN ENTERTAINING PERFORMANCE AS THE CANDIDATE THE LEADER THE OF THE TOWN
03bSnISJMiM_3	AND WE DID A LITTLE A LITTLE BUT OH
Oz06ZWiO20M_11	I THINK MOST PEOPLE THAT'S THEIR KNOCK ON IT IS THAT IT'S NOT IN A CONVENTIONALLY SATISFYING IS LIKE YOU KNOW A DRAMA THAT WE DON'T GET TO KNOW ANYTHING BY THESE CHARACTERS THEIR PLAY ISN'T INTERESTING THEIR PATH TO FREEDOM IS NOT A COMPELLING AND IT'S BASICALLY TELESCOPEED WITHIN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES OF MOVING WHERE WE SORT OF TOLD WHAT'S CAN HAPPENED BEFORE IT HAPPENED
cW1FSBF59ik_8	I LOVE THE NAME WADE
9T9Hf74oK10_2	I PARTICULARLY THE MOVIES THAT I FEEL I SHOULD HAVE GOT NOMINATED BUT DIDN'T AND NEVER LET ME GO AS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE MOVIES
tIrG4oNLFzE_17	SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHY SHE JUST LOOKED THE SAME WHEN EVERYTHING WAS SAID THERE'S PUT ABOUT TWO SCENES I AS SHE THOUGHT YES SHE'S THIS IS HER ACT MISSUS GORD SHE CAN DO THIS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_17	BUT HIS ACTION ISN'T PARTICULARLY MEMORABLE
WKA5OygbEKI_10	IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IT WOULD GOOD BYE
Clx4VXItLTE_24	SO EV'RY ONE LIKE EV'RY ONE AT CINEMA WAS KINDLY AT ME BECAUSE
2WGyTLYerpo_7	MAYBE THAT'S VISUAL FACTS
8d-gEyoeBzc_30	HE COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN OUT
bvLlb-M3UXU_7	YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T NEED A COMPLICATED FORMULA FOR AN ACTION MOVING
POKffnXeBds_12	TWO GIRLS TRYING TOO HARD
tmZoasNr4rU_10	MAYBE ONLY FIVE JOKES MADE ME LAUGH
W8NXH0Djyww_32	I'LL DEFTLY CHECK OUT THE MOVING WRANGLE AH IN THE THEATER NEAR YOU
0h-zjBukYpk_8	AND IN MY OPINION HE CARRIED THE MOVIE FINE
9qR7uwkblbs_31	I KNEW THE INCEPTION THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE
cXypl4FnoZo_9	SO THE MORE LIKE WOMEN DOCTORS I SEE YOU KNOW I I LIKE SEEING THAT
cXypl4FnoZo_2	AND I'M I'LL JUST SAY IT OVER ALL IF I THINK IT WAS GOOD
k5Y_838nuGo_30	OH BEY IT'S IT'S BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE ABSOLUTELY
cXypl4FnoZo_29	I DON'T LIKE PETER
_dI--eQ6qVU_7	AND MOST OF YOU KNOW HE'S A PRETTY FUNNY GUY AND
Clx4VXItLTE_25	EVERY TIME THAT WAS LIKE A JOLLY BIT EVERY ONE JOHN
2iD-tVS8NPw_29	LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT I GOT TO SAY
tStelxIAHjw_6	I LIKE TRYIN YOU KNOW
dq3Nf_lMPnE_7	BUT ALSO NOT VERY ORIGINAL SHRIKES
73jzhE8R1TQ_17	I I SAID IT WASN'T THE IDEA
VbQk4H8hgr0_29	A SPLIT ON THIS ONE JUST AS THEY WERE
8d-gEyoeBzc_13	IN A WELL DRAWN OUT CHARACTER
1iG0909rllw_6	WHEN HE WAS ENJOYABLE I WAS
G6GlGvlkxAQ_23	YOU SOUGHT FOR FOR HOURS IN THE COMETS OF POMPOUS INDIVIDUALS
8d-gEyoeBzc_15	AND I'D SAY THE GIRL WHO WAS THE IS READY SNIPER
OtBXNcAL_lE_1	AND A GUY WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE TONKER'S
v0zCBqDeKcE_11	AND JIM CARRIE I'M A KIND OF I WENT OFF I LOVE AH I USED TO IMITATE HIS COMEDY STYLE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BELIEVE IT OR NOT
I5y0__X72p0_17	NOT POLISHED QUITE AS MUCH AS I LIKE HIM TO BE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_4	DRAWN IT
0h-zjBukYpk_12	NOT IN SPECIAL
Nzq88NnDkEk_12	I'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME
G-xst2euQUc_10	AGAIN IT DOES REALLY TUG AT THE HEART STRINGS WITH THE LITTLE BABY ANIMALS IN THE BEGINNING
Qr1Ca94K55A_2	IT'S PRETTY BAD SHE SAID
k5Y_838nuGo_1	WHICH I WAS NOT SORRY TO SEE
d6hH302o4v8_27	I HAVEN'T IT'S WHAT
d6hH302o4v8_5	YOU ARE BELOW ME
vvZ4IcEtiZc_5	BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF GREAT MOVIES OUT THIS YEAR
2WGyTLYerpo_35	AND HE DOESN'T REALLY THE JOB ALSO
BXuRRbG0Ugk_16	ACTION SEQUENCES ARE CERTAINLY A LOT BETTER THAN THE INCOHERENT AND IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW SLOP THAT WE SEE IN A TYPICAL MICHAEL BAY MOVIE
I5y0__X72p0_3	AS IF THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CONVINCE ME THAT A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL CAN TAKE DOWN LIKE SIX ADULT DUDES
2WGyTLYerpo_12	I DON'T EXPECT THE ACTION TO BE SOMETIMES
5W7Z1C_fDaE_6	DOESN'T HOLD BACK EVERYTHING
f9O3YtZ2VfI_22	I SAID BEFORE IT'S A VERY INTERESTING IDEA
c7UH_rxdZv4_21	I AM PRETTY I HAVE A GIANT'S SMILE I'M SUPPOSED TO KNOW THINGS AND WALK OFF SCREAM
X3j2zQgwYgE_9	BUT LACKS YOU DON'T VERY LACK LUSTRE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_8	A COUPLE OF FUNNY PARTS BEDAD
Ci-AH39fi3Y_39	CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WRITERS FOR THAT
bOL9jKpeJRs_18	IT'S A
cXypl4FnoZo_13	I'M I I DON'T LIKE WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY I DON'T LIKE THIS BUT I WISH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT WHO THE WOLF ACTION TURNED OUT TO BE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_33	SO I'VE LEFT LIKE NO ENCLOSURE AT ALL AT THE END OF THE MOVING
pLTX3ipuDJI_9	I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T HELP MOVING WITH UNKNOWN ACTORS SO EVEN IF SOME ONE IS IN IT FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU SHOULD HELP THEM
bvLlb-M3UXU_18	THERE'S ACTUALLY THERE SEEMS A TRIPLE STAND OFF WITH SYLVESTER ARNOLD SCHWARTZ NIGGER BRUCE WILLIS AND I SHOULDN'T WAKE KIND OF FELT HOLLOW BECAUSE
vyB00TXsimI_9	IF ALL THREE OF THEM WERE PUT TOGETHER
k5Y_838nuGo_12	REALLY THE FIRST ONE HAD THE SAME POINT OF VIEW AS THE FIRST ONE
Vj1wYRQjB-o_8	AH THEY DID NOT GET OUT OF THE CAR
VCslbP0mgZI_16	AND HAS WAGED MUCH VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
aiEXnCPZubE_27	THEY ARE UNIQUE INCREDIBLE
aiEXnCPZubE_22	THEY ARE INTERESTING CHARACTERS
d6hH302o4v8_19	I HAD ONLY ONE AND SOLACED ME WITH A
cM3Yna7AavY_2	IF YOU ARE IT'S BIGGER THAN THIS AS I AM
atnd_PF-Lbs_20	BUTT UP YER LOKE EH SAY THAT YOU SEE TWO SCENES THAT'S ISN'T HERE UNIQUE IT'S A BIT HARSH
vyB00TXsimI_17	AND THERE'S A BETTER ON TOP OF THE TRAIN FLIGHT THAN THE FIRST MISSION IMPOSSIBLE MOVIE
GWuJjcEuzt8_15	AND OVER I'LL PROBABLY I'LL GIVE IT ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE STARS YOU KNOW POP SIMMURI AND YOU KNOW CASSULI
dq3Nf_lMPnE_4	THEY SAW THIS DILEMMA BY REMOVING THE PAST WITHIN IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE TWIST COURTESY OF NEW BETTY RUMPELSTILTSKIN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN
tIrG4oNLFzE_1	NOW I AM A HUGE HUGE FANG OF LITTLE SPARKS I AM
tmZoasNr4rU_6	THE ACTION AND HUMOUR WERE MOSTLY FLAT
6_0THN4chvY_9	BECAUSE HE SAYS ISSUE AND I THINK HE'S SAYING AT YOU
phBUpBr1hSo_20	I DON'T THINK IT WAS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE I'LL SAY THAT THE FIRST MAY BE WAS JUST FANTASTIC
2iD-tVS8NPw_22	THIS IS A PLAYGROUND AND A IMAGINARY PLAYGROUND AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT ALSO MADE THE FILM EXCITING
8qrpnFRGt2A_18	OF COURSE THIS CANNOT BE MAKING THEM LOOK GOOD WHICH IS FINE
v0zCBqDeKcE_15	I LOVE ALL ASPECTS OF MOVIES
jUzDDGyPkXU_17	THE DIALOGUE IS TERRIBLE
0h-zjBukYpk_14	IT'S A SMART MOVE SINCE YOU KNOW YET TO BE A REAL COMIC BOOK FAN TO GET WHAT HIS NAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_12	ITS COLORFUL AND
8d-gEyoeBzc_1	I AM ONLY TO GIVE THE REASONS WHY I LIKE HIM
c7UH_rxdZv4_32	YES SKIPPET
fvVhgmXxadc_9	CONNELL LOOKS LIKE A RADIO GAME IN A CERTAIN WAY
rnaNMUZpvvg_3	I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BE GOOD
nbWiPyCm4g0_6	THIS IS REALLY JUST THE CONTINUATION OF THE FIRST FILM
8qrpnFRGt2A_22	BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A CARTOON WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH MOSTLY IS WITH ALL THE SEEDY EYE EFFECTS
W8NXH0Djyww_31	AH EVERYTHING ELSE HELD UP ITS OWN
8qrpnFRGt2A_3	SO I DIDN'T HAVE VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS MOVIE
atnd_PF-Lbs_13	THE BALANCE HERE IS PRETTY BAD
LSi-o-IrDMs_12	POP CORN RUBY
7JsX8y1ysxY_36	AND AH THERE'S NOT IN MY OPINION THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH OF A BALANCE BETWEEN SO IT LOOKED A GOOD AND EVIL KIND OF THING
MLal-t_vJPM_14	SO I'M UP ONTO IT AGAIN
Clx4VXItLTE_17	REALLY SURPRISED AS I HAVE SAID THEY WERE NOT ONE OF THE WHOLE
BioHAh1qJAQ_2	AH I THOUGHT THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO HAVE A CHANCE HE CALLED BECAUSE
d3_k5Xpfmik_13	REALLY IS GOOD I MEAN
zhpQhgha_KU_14	BUT A LOT OF THE FOOTAGE WAS KIND OF ON US
2iD-tVS8NPw_9	THE REST OF IT DOES LOOK GOOD AS WELL
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_5	I THOUGHT THEY'D CAST A CONWELL
tStelxIAHjw_2	I I THINK THE LAST RUBY I SAW IN THEATRES WAS TWENTY THREE AND I HATED IT
GWuJjcEuzt8_1	THE FIRST THING'S FIRST CHRISTINA ADELA'S PIPES I SWEAR THEY AIN'T THAT ON'T
QN9ZIUWUXsY_2	AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD MOVE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_42	IT WAS PRETTY MUCH JUST AN EXCUSE TO PUT TRAPS IN THE MOVING BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT
d3_k5Xpfmik_9	M YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE FOR YOURSELF
Njd1F0vZSm4_8	IN FACT MY SIX YEAR OLD WAS SCARED MOST OF THE MOODY
W8NXH0Djyww_12	AND IT WAS JUST AS HYSTERICAL
7JsX8y1ysxY_32	SO OVER ALL IT'S IT'S LIKE A BLEND OF YOU GOT AN ALTERNATIVE HISTORY
Iu2PFX3z_1s_15	I THINK BUT WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THIS WAS THAT HE REALLY TRIED VERY HARD TO MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_4	YET HE WAS ALL RIGHT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_8	AND REALLY LIKED US
WKA5OygbEKI_7	IN CORK'S PRIDE HE'S REALLY GETTING CLARK'S BRIDE AND
5W7Z1C_fDaE_15	THE HOR FILM IN THE TRUE SENSE THAT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_38	AND IF IT VERY WELL INTO THE SERIES OF MY OPINIONS SO
W8NXH0Djyww_22	A COVERED WAGON HORSE KIND OF COWBOY CHASE SEQUENCE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_7	AND I THINK THAT BLUE VALENTINE HAS ONLY BECOME KIND OF UNDERRATED
BvYR0L6f2Ig_2	I THOUGHT THAT THE FIRST ONE WAS CREATIVE AND INVENTIVE AND REALLY BROUGHT SOMETHING NEW TO THE SERVICE
wMbj6ajWbic_14	SUMMER WAS COME A WEEK AT THE ASHLEYS AND ASKED ME
tStelxIAHjw_12	LIGHT SERIOUSLY
8d-gEyoeBzc_9	THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL DEVELOPED ARE NOT ALL OTHER CHARACTERS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_12	IT'S STILL A PRETTY ENJOYABLE RIDE IF YOU GO IN WANTING TO SEE A BUNCH OF COWBOYS BATTLE UPON THE ALIENS YEAH YOU'LL PRETTY MUCH GET YOUR FILL
Qr1Ca94K55A_12	I THOUGHT IT WAS ASKING ME MORE THAN THAT BUT I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT I AM
Clx4VXItLTE_9	LAKE IT CRACKED ON STRAIGHTWAY WITH WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON
cW1FSBF59ik_9	BUT I DO NOT TAKE MY AND REYNOLDS SERIOUSLY FOR A SHIP IN THIS NAVY
QN9ZIUWUXsY_15	SO MANY MOMENTS IN THIS MOVING THAT I JUST FRAMED AND LIT SO PERFECTLY THAT SO THAT YOU JUST CALL IT CANNA OH THAT'S REALLY REALLY COOL
_dI--eQ6qVU_14	LOVE WHEN PEOPLE DO THIS
jUzDDGyPkXU_11	THEY HAVE REALLY CRUEL TECHNOLOGY THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO WATCH LIKE AND MAKE THEM BLOW UP SHED AND YOU KNOW AND
POKffnXeBds_4	THE MOVING WAS BORING
9J25DZhivz8_15	SAYING YES
9T9Hf74oK10_6	AND IT WAS IT WAS THOUGHTFUL BUT THERE
BI97DNYfe5I_24	BUT I'M HERE I GO CHUCK IT OUT IT'S
vyB00TXsimI_10	YEAH THAT'S ABOUT HOW MY FAVORS GOES
Bfr499ggo-0_13	NOT EVEN NECESSARY TO THE PLOT
LSi-o-IrDMs_23	I HOPE THIS TAKES OVER AS THE NEW SYSTEM
ZAIRrfG22O0_6	IF YOU LIKE THE KIND WE'VE BEEN STILL OR DID A NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM THEN YOU PROBABLY WOULD LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS I
jUzDDGyPkXU_23	BUT HE TOTALLY SELLS IT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_11	AND THE OTHER ONE WAS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
2iD-tVS8NPw_16	NOT REALLY AS YOU UNDERSTAND OF HAVING LIKE ALL THESE THREE CHARACTERS BECAUSE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_23	AND HAL JORDAN FLIES OFF TO THE GREENLAND CALLED PLANET OF OA AND THE MOVIE STARTS SEQUEL BAITING
zhpQhgha_KU_15	AND I MEAN I DO NOT I FEEL LIKE I'M SORRY I WASTED THOSE TWO HOURS I JUST FEEL LIKE I COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING BETTER WITH THEM
6Egk_28TtTM_1	I THINK THAT'S WHAT AN EXCELLENT MOODY CALLED MARS MEANS MARS
G6GlGvlkxAQ_21	YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT FAIRLY QUICKLY
2WGyTLYerpo_47	SHE'S IN EVERYTHING NOW
wMbj6ajWbic_13	IF I HAD SEEN HIM FOR THE SUMMER I'D PROBABLY HAVE RELATED THE BEST ACTIONS I SAW THIS SUMMER
TvyZBvOMOTc_7	IT'S A FINE SHAPE LIKE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_12	LOVE GEOFFREY LOVE AND MICHAEL CLARKE DUNCAN AS THE ACTORS
BI97DNYfe5I_23	I'VE HEARD THAT'S A LAUGH OUT LOUD MOMENTS I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
LSi-o-IrDMs_17	AH BUT THERE THEY WANT TO OSCILLATE
c7UH_rxdZv4_18	WHAT WHAT IS WHAT FOR WHY YOU HAVE NO SKILLS WHATSOEVER
G-xst2euQUc_3	I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO GO TO SEE IT
tStelxIAHjw_5	AND I REALLY HATED CARDS
HEsqda8_d0Q_5	I THOUGHT HOW THE HELL IS DICKENS AND DICKENS WORK TOGETHER LIKE A SOUL
LSi-o-IrDMs_4	YOU CAN'T WALK IN EXPECTING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT
_dI--eQ6qVU_10	AND THE HUMOR IT WAS KIND OF NECESSARY
jUzDDGyPkXU_13	BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS QUITE EXPLAINED YOU KNOW LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE OTHERS
wMbj6ajWbic_19	SO YOU MUST NOT OBJECT TO GETTING LIKE A COUNTY OR QUALITY ACTING FOR PERFORMANCES
I5y0__X72p0_26	NINETY PER CENT BORN IDENTITY MEETS TEN PER CENT WILLIE WALKER THERE'S SO
PZ-lDQFboO8_7	EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THE TRAITOR ITSELF IS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE HUMOR YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE MOVIE
Bfr499ggo-0_12	THIS IS TO CUT THE WEDDING AT THE BEGINNING
8OtFthrtaJM_12	NOW THE ONLY SUSPENSEABLE PART THAT I FOUND IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MATT DAMON FIRST DISCOVERS THE BUREAU IN THE FIRST PLACE
I5y0__X72p0_21	AND SO THEY KIND OF EXPLAIN IT A LITTLE BUT NOT REALLY
d3_k5Xpfmik_7	AND WHILE IT ALSO MAINTAINS ITS KIND OF AIR DETACHED A SATIRE OF THE GENERA
VbQk4H8hgr0_3	AND I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT THIS WOULD BE JUST AS GOOD
etzxEpPuc6I_11	LIKE EVEN THE ACTORS WERE DISLIKED YOU KNOW IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT A FOOT AND TOY
2WGyTLYerpo_48	S AND FLIES HERE AND
aiEXnCPZubE_13	DOESN'T HAVE ANY PRESENTS OR GREATNESS AT ALL
7JsX8y1ysxY_30	AH HE'S BEEN VERY GOOD DROP ACTING
aiEXnCPZubE_18	JOHN AND ANN SCOTLAND COULD BRING THEM YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE INTERESTING CHARACTERS
TvyZBvOMOTc_14	EVEN WHEN THEY ARE FIGHTING IN THE RUBY THOUGH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S THEIR BANTER NOT ACTUAL DISLIKE
7JsX8y1ysxY_25	LIKE HE WAS INCREDIBLE
tmZoasNr4rU_3	I COULDN'T GET INTO IT
9T9Hf74oK10_18	SO LOOK OUT FOR THAT THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING
ob23OKe5a9Q_5	THAT IS I GUESS THE ONLY PROOF I HAVE OF IT IS THAT AND THE JOKES ARE VERY EASY
Oz06ZWiO20M_8	BUT IT'S NOT BAD I THINK THE WAY MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING IT'S BETTER
d6hH302o4v8_43	SO SEIZING THE WITCH'S EARNED THREE OUT OF TEN SO
Ci-AH39fi3Y_32	THE RUBY WAS GOOD
vyB00TXsimI_8	ANY ONE WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS THAT LORD OF THE RING'S TRILOGY IS PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE MOVING EVER
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_18	A RUSSELL CROW AND CAPE BLANCHET JUST DID NOT SELL IT FOR ME I HAD A VERY HARD TIME JUST BUYING IT
tmZoasNr4rU_17	THE ACTION'S IT'S I'M IT IT'S IT'S PRETTY MUCH JUST A QUICK CUT OR SLASH BLOOD SCREEN YOU KNOW
HEsqda8_d0Q_34	WHEREAS IT IS DISASTROUS THOUGH ENJOYING
9J25DZhivz8_1	OH HE IS ADORABLE
PZ-lDQFboO8_4	OR EVEN THE KID'S IN THE AUDIENCE ITSELF JUST KIND OF CHUCK WITH A LITTLE BEAR GAVE A FEW LAUGHS
jUzDDGyPkXU_4	SOME ONE WATCHED THE THIRD ACT OF DISTRICT NINE BUNCHED ON LIKE LET'S MAKE THIS INTO AN ENTIRE MOVIE IT'LL BE AWESOME AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT THEY DID HERE BUT
c7UH_rxdZv4_3	I WISH IT WEREN'T BECAUSE I
zhpQhgha_KU_34	AND SHE REALLY ENDED THE FILM
9T9Hf74oK10_16	I MEAN IN HER OTHER WORKS LIKE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE SHE'S JUST BEEN REALLY FANTASTIC AND
2WGyTLYerpo_40	HE BECOMES MORE LIKABLE
IumbAb8q2dM_8	IT WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD
cW1FSBF59ik_7	COULD HE THINK
v0zCBqDeKcE_8	AND CARRY YOU MACGREGOR I LIKE THE TWO OF THEM
9J25DZhivz8_25	BUT WHAT MADE THIS MOVIE REALLY FUN WAS SOME OF THE ADULT HUMOR JABS
W8NXH0Djyww_13	AND THE STUFF HE SAID WAS JUST IT WAS JUST SO FUNNY
d3_k5Xpfmik_11	THIS CRITIC SEQUENCE I THINK IS THE BEST CRITIC SEQUINS ER SINCE WATCHMAN
W8NXH0Djyww_1	WAS JUST FANTASTIC SURPRISED
G-xst2euQUc_18	AND WE REALLY WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE ON LAST NIGHT YESTERDAY WAS
tIrG4oNLFzE_13	LIKE THOSE OF THOSE THOSE OF THE MOMENTS IN THE FILM ESPECIALLY THE BEGINNING WHEN SHE'D SIT THERE STANDING ACROSS AND WITH HER ARMS CROSSED AND JUST LOOK OUT INTO THE DISTANCE LIKE THIS AND WITH THIS SAME EXPRESSION OR SHE'D LOOK ACROSS THE BEACH OR SHE'D LOOK AT HER DAD OR SHE'D LOOK AT HER BROTHER WITH THE PLAYING EXPRESSION AND I WAS JUST LIKE WHAT ARE YOU THINKING I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S YOU DOIN LIKE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_19	TWO OTHERS WERE JUST BORN
jUzDDGyPkXU_18	THERE IS NO GOOD DIALOGUE
pLTX3ipuDJI_13	JUST WHEN THE GIRL TELLS THE EXACT STORY OF THE FIRST RUBY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_2	YEAH A JOB PRETTY WELL DONE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_16	ANYWAY THE THIRD ONE ACTING IT WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE SECOND ONE ANYWAY
VbQk4H8hgr0_2	I LOVE THE FIRST SHRIMP AND THE SECOND TRICK AND
etzxEpPuc6I_18	THERE WAS PARTS THIS FUSSY AND SOME CREATIVE DEATH AS WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
VCslbP0mgZI_15	SO IF I GIVE THE OUTSIDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THIS IS THE RUBY THAT LOOKS GREAT HAS SOME BAD ACTING
Nzq88NnDkEk_2	AH BUT FORTUNATELY I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_7	SO I THINK THAT NOTIONS ATTACHED WAS BETTER THAN PRESENT BENEFITS
BvYR0L6f2Ig_23	BUT MARY WEST I MUST SAY SHE'S A TERRIFIC AND BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED ACTRESS SHE DISPLACED
lXPQBPVc5Cw_21	THE BEGINNINGS OF A THREE WITH A COUPLE OF GOOD JOKES
GWuJjcEuzt8_13	AND THE SONGS IN THE MOVIE ARE WONDERFUL
VbQk4H8hgr0_11	REALLY THAT THAT
BI97DNYfe5I_27	I EXPECTED A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUSNESS
c7UH_rxdZv4_30	AND ER IT IS KIND OF INTERESTING
etzxEpPuc6I_3	I'M FROM THERE ONLY IT JUST GOES INTO RIDICULOUSNESS
Ci-AH39fi3Y_10	ONE OF THEM WAS GREAT
d6hH302o4v8_34	I HAVEN'T IT'S WHAT
QN9ZIUWUXsY_9	THE SCRIPT CAN BE HORRIBLE IF
5W7Z1C_fDaE_10	COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN HIM DO BEFORE
BI97DNYfe5I_20	AND BEND
yDtzw_Y-7RU_21	AND THAT'S NOT TO BE SAID FOR ONE MINUTE OF YOU
9qR7uwkblbs_16	I DON'T KNOW I GUESS WE BOTH HAVE LIKED THAT LIKE MALE SOUNDING VOICE
BioHAh1qJAQ_11	YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE REFERENCES TO THE FIRST MOVING
2iD-tVS8NPw_27	AND IT DOES KIND OF A LITTLE ALLEVIATE WHAT THAT WHOLE WORRY IS ABOUT FINDING THE ULTIMATE ENEMY WITHIN THIS FIRST MOVING AND THAT THE THREAT IS STILL THERE POTENTIALLY SPEAKING SO
aiEXnCPZubE_25	IT IS SOME SORT OF GREATNESS TO SUCCOR PUNCH THOUGH
2WGyTLYerpo_9	BUT AGAIN YOU CAN'T EXPECT A HUGE LIKE CEREBRAL MIND BENDER FROM A MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS
Nzq88NnDkEk_7	I THINK THE MUSIC OF THE COUNTRY WITH THE CONTRACT REALLY GOT ME EXCITED ABOUT SEEING THIS MOVING IN
fvVhgmXxadc_13	KIND OF PLAYING WITH THE IDEA OF WHAT'S REAL IT'S NOT THAT THE MATRIX FILMS DID
6Egk_28TtTM_9	RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE MY BROTHER IS FIVE YEARS OLD AND HE DIDN'T THINK THIS WOULD BE A SCURVY AT ALL
BvYR0L6f2Ig_9	FIRST I WENT AGAIN TO THE ACTING WHICH WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE SECOND ONE
VCslbP0mgZI_6	THERE ARE SOME REALLY COOL A MOMENTS OF THIS
BvYR0L6f2Ig_14	THEY WERE JUST THEY DID RIGHT AND WERE THEY DOING ANYWAY
BioHAh1qJAQ_7	BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE FIRST THIRD OF THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING
7JsX8y1ysxY_16	FOR AN HOUR
f9O3YtZ2VfI_9	IT DOESN'T IT JUST IT'S TOO MUCH CROP IN HERE
BioHAh1qJAQ_25	DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE
tmZoasNr4rU_19	STILL THE THE CHURCH SHEWED OUT HOWEVER BRIEF THAT WAS IN IT WAS ALL RIGHT
8d-gEyoeBzc_28	IT AIN'T THEY ME OR WE'RE FORDS FISHPOND'S CHARACTER IT DOES SLOW DOWN A GREAT DEAL
Clx4VXItLTE_28	I THINK I'LL TELL THEY'RE CAUGHT WITH GETTING GYP MADE SCARED AND JUMPED INSTEAD OF
f9O3YtZ2VfI_4	BUT I'D JUST TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH IT
I5y0__X72p0_8	IT'S A GREATER UP ACRE JUST FANTASTIC
Njd1F0vZSm4_2	THE SEE HOW I WORK THE THREE IS SPECTACULAR
pLTX3ipuDJI_1	NOTHING NEW IS BROUGHT IN THOSE KIND OF A SERIES NO SURPRISES NO BIG TWIST NO FINISH
Vj1wYRQjB-o_9	THE BIGGER JOB OF THE FLIGHT SCENES
9qR7uwkblbs_17	LIKE A KIND SOUND LIKE I MIGHT HAVE A BEAN
9c67fiY0wGQ_5	THE MOVIE ALSO DELIVERS MANY MEANINGFUL MESSAGES
7JsX8y1ysxY_10	HIS FINE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_8	I'LL GET IT OUT
jUzDDGyPkXU_12	THEY ALWAYS HAD PULL OUT SOMETHING NEW AND
VCslbP0mgZI_4	THIS SUCKER'S GETTING THE SUCKER IT'S GETTING PANNED LIKE LAST AIR BENDER GARBAGE PANNED AND I WANT TO SAY THIS I DID NOT THINK IT WAS LIKE LAST AIR BENDER GARBAGE
fvVhgmXxadc_8	AND AN ALPS OF
bOL9jKpeJRs_3	GREAT DIALOGUE
ob23OKe5a9Q_14	THERE'S A MESS THEY'S NOTHING IN THE ROOMS
vyB00TXsimI_18	SO YES I REALLY ENJOYED IT
MLal-t_vJPM_15	SECOND THERE IS ONE MASSIVE PLOT HOLE IN THIS FILM AND IT IS THE SIZE OF A DRAGON IT'S AS BIG AS A MOUNTAIN AND WHEN YOU SEE THE FILM YOU WILL PROBABLY KNOW WHAT I MEAN
f9O3YtZ2VfI_14	JUST GIVE ME A NICE INTERESTING CHALK
_dI--eQ6qVU_9	SO IT ISN'T SURPRISING
Jkswaaud0hk_12	I I THOUGHT WHAT HE HURTS IN WAS A FUNNY
Sqr0AcuoNnk_18	AND SHE TALKS TO HER TOO
BioHAh1qJAQ_20	BUT THEN SAM FLYNN MEETS HIS FATHER AND TOMMY INSTANTLY TURNED INTO A STAR'S PREQUAL AFTER THAT ONE
HEsqda8_d0Q_22	I DOUBT IF THEY CAN DO THIS FOR ALL THE SCREENINGS BECAUSE IT'S THE PREMIER
d6hH302o4v8_2	NICHOLL'S CAGE SHOULD NOT DO HIS CAIRN MOVIES
bvLlb-M3UXU_21	SEEING IT TO DAY NOW WHERE WAS REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN JUST A WANT OFMANSHIP
8OtFthrtaJM_5	BUT THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT THERE'S A REASON FOR A WHY I WAS CONFUSED
9qR7uwkblbs_32	AND MAYBE HE REALLY GETS SASSY
1DmNV9C1hbY_2	AH I LIVED THE VERY FIRST HOUR IN THE CHIPMUNK'S MOONY BECAUSE
c5xsKMxpXnc_8	NUMBER ONE AS THE LOVE IS FORCED
0h-zjBukYpk_9	AND OH NOTHING GREAT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_21	HE'S NOT GAME YOU LOOKIN LIKE A CHIPPER A BRIGHT YOUNG MAN BUT EARLY THIRTIES REALLY YOU WANT ME TO BUY THAT
zhpQhgha_KU_5	WHEN I'D JUST WRITTEN I JUST SAID I DIDN'T KNOW I'D LIKE TO LIVE BEYOND THAT
Qr1Ca94K55A_6	IT MADE IT HYSTERICAL AND IT WAS JUST FUNNY WITH ALL OF HIS LITTLE ONE LINERS THAT HE HAD AND
zhpQhgha_KU_3	BUT THIS MOVING KIND OF CAME OFF LATE SO THAT HE IS REALLY SAD TO TRAVEL WITH YOU I DON'T KNOW
_dI--eQ6qVU_15	THEY JUST COME UP WITH THESE TOTALLY COMPLETELY NEW STYLES WAYS OF DEVELOPING ACTION SEQUENCES
I5y0__X72p0_18	IT IS GOOD THOUGH LIKE
PZ-lDQFboO8_5	NOW NOT GET ALIVE THERE ARE A FEW PARTS THAT HAVE GREAT ACTUAL SEQUENCES NOW EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN ANIMATED FILM IT DID HAVE SOME GREAT FINE SCENES
bOL9jKpeJRs_26	ER ER UM
f9O3YtZ2VfI_11	JUST TRY TO CUT THAT OUT
nbWiPyCm4g0_8	LET ME SEE IF I CAN RUSTLE UP SOME SYMPATHY HE ADDED
73jzhE8R1TQ_5	CRIED TOM I WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT IT
9T9Hf74oK10_11	AND I THINK THAT THE MOVIE DID RELY ON YOU TO KIND OF FIGURE IT OUT AND KIND OF DEAL WITH THOSE IDEAS BY YOURSELF
k5Y_838nuGo_25	THE QUOTE IN THIS WAY WITH THEM SOUNDED SO DIRTY COMING OUT
PZ-lDQFboO8_1	I WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THE FAMILY
0h-zjBukYpk_7	A FEW JACK MEN WAS ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE TO PLAY WOLVERINE I WILL ADMIT THAT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_22	AND I GUESS THAT SORT OF TRUE BECAUSE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_8	THE PERFORMANCES ARE ME
Ci-AH39fi3Y_27	IT WAS NOT A HUGE SORE TWISTED MOMENT
W8NXH0Djyww_20	I AM SURE WHAT THEY WERE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_3	HE TAKES GREAT ACTORS OR ACTRESSES IN THIS CASE LIKE SUSY RUNE AND AND CAPE
9J25DZhivz8_24	I ALWAYS THINK IT IS HILARIOUS
BioHAh1qJAQ_5	AS A KIND OF CONTROLS OUR LIVES SO IT WAS A PERFECT TIME FOR A TRICYCLE
wMbj6ajWbic_11	I AIN'T GOING TO THIS MOODY EXPECTED TO SEE THE DARK NIGHT
nbWiPyCm4g0_5	ALSO IF YOU'RE A STRAIGHT MAN AND YOU VOLUNTARILY WILLINGLY GO AND SEE THIS FILM I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO LIGHT A CANDLE SAY A PRAYER AND ASK YOURSELF SOME QUESTIONS
atnd_PF-Lbs_10	IT'S A JOKE REALLY
f_pcplsH_V0_7	OR FOR THE LAST TIME TOO I THINK
03bSnISJMiM_6	AND THE MORE IN THE
73jzhE8R1TQ_19	I'M ANOTHER THING THAT YOU'D BOTHER ME WERE THE CASSIAN'S SON JOHN
9qR7uwkblbs_1	WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL RYE AND GOSLING LEATHER SHOE AND SUIT
QN9ZIUWUXsY_14	I MEAN THIS MOVIE HAS THE MOST GORGEOUS VISUALS OUT OF ANY MOVIE SINCE PROBABLY AVENTURE MADE IF NOT PRETTIER
f_pcplsH_V0_2	BUT ONE OF YOU MORE I EXPECT THE THUMBS UP
Oz06ZWiO20M_20	AND THEN YOU'LL PUT IN SOME ACTION OR SOME ROMANCE IN SACKS OR WHATEVER LIKE TO KEEP PEOPLE SORT OF DIDN'T IT
BI97DNYfe5I_29	IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS THEN
lXPQBPVc5Cw_20	UM YES SO WE WERE OUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT I WAS TEXTING I JUST LIKE I HADN'T ABSOLUTELY SO SOON HAD NO BROUGHT TO ME
Ci-AH39fi3Y_23	I SURE DIDN'T SEE THE END COMING
MLal-t_vJPM_7	IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH
IumbAb8q2dM_13	I I CAN'T WAIT TILL THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT TOO I
Sqr0AcuoNnk_16	AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST LIKE REALLY NATURAL AND FUNNY
VbQk4H8hgr0_20	IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER I COULD I SAW IT BEING SO MUCH BETTER IN MY HEAD BUT IT JUST WASN'T IT DISAPPOINTING
2WGyTLYerpo_22	THE CAT'S SCARY LOOKING
WKA5OygbEKI_2	WRANGLE AS YOU REALLY KEEP ME V E I
VbQk4H8hgr0_10	IT'S NOTHING MEANS OR NOTHING
zhpQhgha_KU_13	IT COULD HAVE BEEN SHORTER
Sqr0AcuoNnk_1	I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T IT'S SO WEIRD
8d-gEyoeBzc_8	I AM IN A POINT OF THE STUFF I DID LIKE I AM THERE WAS SOME GOOD ACTION SCENES IN IT
8qrpnFRGt2A_14	ABOUT TWO HOURS WAS WAY TOO LONG FOR THIS MOODY
G-xst2euQUc_8	GREAT FOR ALL AGES
2WGyTLYerpo_29	KIND OF CHANNELS A MAN WITH NO NAME CLUTE EASTWARD
nzpVDcQ0ywM_8	I THINK YOU WILL REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE A
G-xst2euQUc_1	IT WAS A RIDICULE MURPHY
Clx4VXItLTE_5	CERTAINLY IMMUNE TO THEM
Af8D0E4ZXaw_11	WITH YOU BEFORE I GET TO THE NEGATIVES OF THE MOVIE LET ME LIST OFF A FEW POSITIVES
9J25DZhivz8_13	AND THERE WAS MAY BE ONE TIME WHEN I THOUGHT I ACTUALLY HEARD RUSSELL BRAND HIMSELF
etzxEpPuc6I_7	BUT THE THING ABOUT GEE I JOKE AND PAY THE TRANSFORMERS IS JUST ONE'S TOO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO DO LIKE
Jkswaaud0hk_4	YOU GUY IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET TO ENJOY IT
jUzDDGyPkXU_25	THAT'S ALL RIGHT AND MOVING ON THERE'S NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN THIS MOODY NONE
_dI--eQ6qVU_17	BUT WHEN THEY FIGURE OUT A NEW WAY TO INTERPRET THEM
pLTX3ipuDJI_12	HE CUT LAWRENCE FISHER ONE COMES IN AND TELLS THE CHARACTERS THINGS THAT ONLY SCREEN WRITERS SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE MORE OF A FEAT PHONY FEELS THIS WHOLE THING
2WGyTLYerpo_28	DINGLE CRAIG DOES A VERY GOOD JOB HERE
Njd1F0vZSm4_3	THE FLYING SEQUENCES ARE BEAUTIFUL
BioHAh1qJAQ_12	YOU HAVE NEW CHARACTERS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A RELATION TO THE OLD ONES
73jzhE8R1TQ_13	THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU IF YOUR TOP PRIORITY IS SURVIVAL AND WHY WOULD YOU BE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW ME
yDtzw_Y-7RU_15	THIS THING IS AS MUCH TO BE SEEN IN THREE D WHICH IS
zhpQhgha_KU_31	AH BUT LIKE AS IF YOU'D LIKE IT YOU'RE FREE TO SEE IT I JUST PERSONALLY WASN'T LET INTO IT
BioHAh1qJAQ_9	BUT YOU KNOW THE PACING IS SO GOOD
cXypl4FnoZo_6	AND I'M I LIKE YOU DON'T CARE WHAT I'S LIKE YOU KNOW KIND OF RIDICULOUS
X3j2zQgwYgE_4	IN THE OUTLAY
vvZ4IcEtiZc_8	IT'S TRULY HEART BREAKING TO SEE THAT CONTRASTED WITH THE STATE OF THINGS
G-xst2euQUc_6	I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT
Clx4VXItLTE_23	SOME LIKE WHAT I DO LIKE IF I'D JUMP I'D LAUGH
bOL9jKpeJRs_9	I REALLY FELT THAT THEY WERE DEAD IN THE EXPERIMENTS
6_0THN4chvY_14	I DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED
TvyZBvOMOTc_8	BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT IS REALLY HOLD UP UNDER INSPECTION
yDtzw_Y-7RU_20	THEIR EYES ARE LIKE THIS THEY ARE OPEN TO THE FULL EXPRESS
_dI--eQ6qVU_26	I FEEL LIKE EVEN THOUGH THE FIGHTING SEQUENCES WERE A LITTLE BIT LONG IN SOME PLACES
Af8D0E4ZXaw_13	TO A GREAT JOB WITH THER RULES THERE
zhpQhgha_KU_24	NOT BEING REALLY STRETCHED OUT AND
8OtFthrtaJM_23	BUT HE'S JUST THE CREEPIEST OLD GUY YOU'LL EVER SEE IN YOUR LIFE HE STANDS OVER PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE ASLEEP JUST STARING AT THEM
9J25DZhivz8_19	I MEAN MY STOMACH WAS ALMOST GONE AS WE WENT DOWN THE BIG DROP
2WGyTLYerpo_37	AND FORBES ALSO GOOD HE'S
8d-gEyoeBzc_18	I'M THE HEAD OF IT THERE'S ENOUGH IN THERE FOR YOU TO CARE ABOUT HIM
zhpQhgha_KU_30	BECAUSE THERE REALLY WASN'T ALL THAT MUCH TO IT FOR ME
aiEXnCPZubE_1	AS MEDIOCRE IN A WALL NO
Af8D0E4ZXaw_18	WAS BY FAR MY FAVOURITE ACTIONS IN THE MOVIE
Vj1wYRQjB-o_1	WELL HE PLAYS THAT WELL SO HE'S A GOOD VILLAIN
9qR7uwkblbs_7	OF MICHELE'S RUNNING JOSTLING
Nzq88NnDkEk_17	AT THE STRINGING I WAS THAT I I COULDN'T FIND AND FOUND MYSELF YOU KNOW WANTING TO LAY MY HEAD BACK AND TAKE A NAP AND
_dI--eQ6qVU_3	I DON'T KNOW IF FANS OF THE COMIC WOULD BE AS INCLINED TO SAY THE SAME BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT DIFFERS FROM THE COMIC OR THE RADIO PROGRAMME THAT PEOPLE LIKE SO MUCH
Qr1Ca94K55A_4	BUT THE REAL STAR THAT FELL UP THIS MOVING IT WAS WILLIAM PINCHER'S CHARACTER A WILLING INVENTION
bOL9jKpeJRs_15	BLACKBIRD IS A GREATER DIRECTOR
zhpQhgha_KU_28	YES I MEAN IT IT HAS SOME FINE MOMENTS
cM3Yna7AavY_6	ANYWAY OH YOU CAN SEE HIM STILL SPEECHLESS AS RUBY WAS BEAUTIFUL
dq3Nf_lMPnE_11	IN THEIR PLACE IS A RUN IN A MILL ANIMATED ACTION ADVENTURE PLOT WITH A FEW CHUCKLES THROWN IN
VbQk4H8hgr0_23	I WISH TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK
QN9ZIUWUXsY_16	AND THEN TAKE THAT WORLD AND THEN SET LIKE A CRACKED TONE OF REALLY REALLY WELL DONE ACTION SEQUENCES IN IT AND YOU HAVE DRAWN LEGACY
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_7	AIN'T FINAL THAT GOOD
fvVhgmXxadc_10	THE FIRST TIME SHE GOES IN IT LOOKS LIKE A JAPANESE TEMPLE
9T9Hf74oK10_17	ANDREW GARFIELD OF COURSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM FROM THE SOCIAL NETWORK
LSi-o-IrDMs_18	ITSELF REALLY HAD IMPROVED
TvyZBvOMOTc_5	ALTHOUGH I ENJOYED THE LILY
Nzq88NnDkEk_29	A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL YOU KNOW LOVED IT
d6hH302o4v8_10	AND WHEN WE WAS TALKING ABOUT IN
G6GlGvlkxAQ_7	FOR HE WAS WINNING THERE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_36	DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO CLOSE IT AT ALL LIKE THE WIND ISN'T GOING TO BLOW IT OVER ANYTHING IT'S JUST OPEN
Jkswaaud0hk_11	BUT MADAME IT WAS I IN NOT A TASTE
Qr1Ca94K55A_9	IT WAS I WAS GOOD
fvVhgmXxadc_6	SHE GETS THERE IS FORCED TO NOT ONLY BE TRAPPED IN THE LOCATION THAT SHE PROMISES NOT TO BE IN
zhpQhgha_KU_11	I JUST PERSONALLY I JUST DIDN'T REALLY ENJOY IT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_3	NUMBER ONE IT MEANS IT'S MUCH HEAVIER THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE
aiEXnCPZubE_23	COULD HAVE AN INTERESTING BACK STORY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_28	AH SO THAT WAS A LITTLE SURPRISING I GUESS
W8NXH0Djyww_27	DEFTLY RECOMMENDED CHECKING SEEING THE LAW CHECKING THE SMOOTHING OUT
8OtFthrtaJM_18	DAMON IS A YOU KNOW HE'S A PRETTY FUNNY GUY
2WGyTLYerpo_2	IS A LOT OF FORTY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_9	AH IT'S JUST MADE ME REALLY REALLY EXCITED FOR
OtBXNcAL_lE_10	I THOUGHT THIS REALLY WOULD BE FUNNY
etzxEpPuc6I_13	THIS WON'T PART WITH THE GIRLS LIKE MY DADDY TOLD ME YOU WOULD WHEN I SHOULD BEGIN TO COME HOME LIKE A WELL I CAN THIS ACTING'S PRETTY BAD
Sqr0AcuoNnk_21	ANOTHER THING IS LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP OR POSITIVE GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN THIS HARMONY
2WGyTLYerpo_20	FOR YOU TO
d3_k5Xpfmik_16	SEQUENCES WERE REALLY WELL ON AND OUT
OQvJTdtJ2H4_9	THE PREVIOUS ARE MUCH MORE THIRTIETH THAN AT AND SO THERE'S VERY DISAPPOINTING
phBUpBr1hSo_3	I THINK THAT THE MOVIES ARE PHENOMENAL ESPECIALLY THAT FIRST ONE
Qr1Ca94K55A_11	AND SOME REALLY COOL GUN FIGHT
OQvJTdtJ2H4_15	AH MEDUSA WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM PERCY JACK'S IN THE LAND OF LAWS WHICH
G6GlGvlkxAQ_27	STILL HE HAD LEARNED FROM THE EARTHLINGS
v0zCBqDeKcE_12	I MEAN HE EVEN FAKED HAVING AIDS TO GET OUT OF PRISON
tmZoasNr4rU_8	BUT I JUST DIDN'T LAUGH
dq3Nf_lMPnE_15	SHRICK FOR EVER AFTER DIRECTED BY MIKE MITCHELL A GRADE OF B MINUS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_16	THE TWO WOMEN IN THIS MOVIE ARE PARTICULARLY GOOD LOOKING
2iD-tVS8NPw_21	I THINK HAVEN'T THAT SORT OF A SUPER POWER ALMOST THIS POWER TO JUST IMAGINE ANYTHING CAN'T IT JUST A HELP ME GET PAST THAT NEARLY THESE OR I'LL SEE GEOMETRS AND SAID
Sqr0AcuoNnk_5	I JUST DON'T THINK IT WAS VERY GOOD
Vj1wYRQjB-o_7	THE ACTION THEY DO HAVE IS REALLY WELL DONE
MLal-t_vJPM_16	AH THERE'S NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS THING
tStelxIAHjw_1	I I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE LAST TIME WE SAW THEATERS AND TO GIVE A REVIEW FOR IT
pLTX3ipuDJI_11	ALTHOUGH WHAT HE DID DO WAS INTERESTING BUT HE DIDN'T MAKE SENSE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_3	IT WAS A CALL BOBBY
Iu2PFX3z_1s_7	THERE'S ALL THESE COLORFUL CHARACTERS
G6GlGvlkxAQ_29	YET A LITTLE SHE'LL IN BOB'S WHICH IS COOLER THAN SEE THAT A LOT OF COOLER RECORDS SAYS THAT AT ONE POINT OF REFERENCE I'M A DOCTOR WITH CAMERA RADIATION
LSi-o-IrDMs_25	IT BE CALLED TO SEE A MAN EVENTUAL
0h-zjBukYpk_20	BUT THE TWO BIG CHARACTER APPEARANCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE EASILY DEAD PULL AND DAMN IT
vyB00TXsimI_14	THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TYPES OF MOVIES I
c7UH_rxdZv4_7	A HORRIBLE PROTAGONIST
Af8D0E4ZXaw_29	THIS IS STEWART'S TERRITORY
HEsqda8_d0Q_8	HE'S BEEN SUCH A GRUM HE CHARACTER AND THEN HE'S REALLY SCARED AND AT THE END HE'S SO CHANGED AND IT'S REALLY FUNNY
VbQk4H8hgr0_36	AND NONE OF THEM WERE REALLY THAT GREAT I DIDN'T STAND OUT IN YOUR MIND
I5y0__X72p0_27	SOME REALLY STRANGE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK
8d-gEyoeBzc_12	FOR HE WAS SO WELL DEVELOPED
BXuRRbG0Ugk_31	DIFFERENT PEOPLE GOT WRITING CREDIT FOR THIS MOVIE AND THE RESULTS ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT
bvLlb-M3UXU_5	REALLY THERE'S NO MONKISH TALES IN THESE GUISE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_3	IT THERE LOOKED LIKE IT HAD A GOOD CORE
Oz06ZWiO20M_24	IT'S REALLY LIKE IF YOU WANT TO GO SEE THE BALLET AND IT'S ABOUT THE SPECTACLES
lXPQBPVc5Cw_9	BUT IT WAS JUST IT WAS LIKE I'M NOT CAN EVEN LIGHT YOU GUYS I FELL ASLEEP AROUND THE MIDDLE OF IT AND WOKE UP LIKE WHAT HAS HAPPENED
WKA5OygbEKI_22	THANKS FOR THIS AND ME RAMBLE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_23	ON AND IN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE IT WAS LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON LIKE
bvLlb-M3UXU_4	AND YET THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLELY ENJOYABLE FOR ACTION FANS ALL
WKA5OygbEKI_12	YOU HAVE LITTLE CANS TO BRING WITH YOU
MLal-t_vJPM_18	OTHER THAN THOSE TWO THINGS
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_6	BUT WHAT REALLY THREW ME OFF WAS THE DIALOGUE VERY CHEESY DIALOGUE
VbQk4H8hgr0_19	AND SIMPLY IT WAS DULL FOR ME
bOL9jKpeJRs_2	HE WAS FULL OF ACTION
rnaNMUZpvvg_6	COULD BARELY STAY AWAKE THROUGH THE MOVIE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_12	IT SEEMED LIKE THE WRITERS AND CREATORS TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT
HEsqda8_d0Q_11	THE ANIMATION WAS AMAZING
8qrpnFRGt2A_17	POOR STEWART
2iD-tVS8NPw_18	REALLY THE WRATH OF YOUR GUN TO GO
6Egk_28TtTM_6	AND I WILL RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR AGES DUENNA
lXPQBPVc5Cw_16	I I WILL I WILL ACTUALLY SAY THIS RIGHT NOW IT WAS A GOOD WASTE OF LIKE TWELVE DOLLARS
OQvJTdtJ2H4_8	AND THEN IT'S DEFTLY NOT THE LEAST MOVING
03bSnISJMiM_5	AGAINST THE MISSIONARY
k5Y_838nuGo_6	THE FIRST TWO WERE PRETTY EXCELLENT
vyB00TXsimI_15	REALLY LOVES THE MELODRAMATIC OVER THE TOP CRAZY ACTION SORT OF THING GOING ON
d3_k5Xpfmik_4	IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT YOU REALLY CAN'T TRUST ANY ONE IN THIS SITUATION
d6hH302o4v8_16	HE WAS VERY BORING
9c67fiY0wGQ_12	THE SMURS ARE SO ADORABLE AND THEY GO ON THRILLING ADVENTURES
Sqr0AcuoNnk_6	AND THIS IS A THING FOR AS THE BENEFITS AND NOTIONS ATTACHED THEY ARE THE SAME MOVING DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING TO THE SAME POINT BUT AT THE SAME POINT
Oz06ZWiO20M_3	I DON'T THINK IT'S LIKE THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVEN SEEN JUST THIS YEAR
tStelxIAHjw_11	I JUST HATED IT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_18	SO YOU CAN'T GO SEE IT
2WGyTLYerpo_61	WAS REALLY FOND OF
k5Y_838nuGo_26	BUT IT WAS GREAT
d6hH302o4v8_33	IT WAS TERRIBLE WHITE
8d-gEyoeBzc_17	I'M LIKE THE RUSSIAN GUY AH YOU ARE I THINK
zhpQhgha_KU_18	THE MOST OF THE CHARACTERS OF THE HOME REMAINED
Nzq88NnDkEk_27	DISAPPOINTMENT DEFTLY I DO
TvyZBvOMOTc_9	ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT COME TO STOP THEM GETTING TO THEIR DESTINATION ARE ALTHOUGH PLAUSIBLE A LITTLE WEAK
iiK8YX8oH1E_5	ON IT KIND OF FOLLOWS THE PATH OF MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN TO ROBERTS MAY BE ACCEPTED IT TAKES THIRTY MINUTES LONGER TO DEVIATE FROM THE SCRIPTS OF MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
tStelxIAHjw_8	I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FUNNY
d6hH302o4v8_28	HALF THE LAST HALF ON THE LOUIS AND THEY LIKE TO HAVE OUT AND LET US SEE YOU AT WORK AS OF OLD
aiEXnCPZubE_2	IS NEVER A FEELING OF STARK QUALITY WITH HER
2iD-tVS8NPw_5	IS THE MOON THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND SEE
d6hH302o4v8_6	AND TAKES HIM SERIOUSLY
2WGyTLYerpo_5	THE ONLY OSCAR I COULD EVEN THINK OF HIS MAY BE LIKED BEST IN PHOTOGRAPHY
etzxEpPuc6I_15	NO ONE HAS HAD THE BAD ONE
WKA5OygbEKI_4	I WILL ADMIT I'M AFRAID JOHNNIE GOT HER HAND
2WGyTLYerpo_44	AND SHE'S NOT A BAD ACTOR SHE'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD AND SHE'S IN EVERYTHING AND FLAT THERE'S FLAWS HERE AND THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT HUGE GLARING FLAWS BUT THEY ARE NOTICEABLE FLAWS SUCH AS SOMETIMES THE ALIENS IN THE WESTERN SETTING DO LOOK A LITTLE GOOSEY BUT I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING THAT AH THERE'S A PLOT TO US THOUGH I CAN'T SAY I WASN'T AFRAID OF IT I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF STUPID AND SOMETIMES A KIND OF VIEWS INTO CLICHY ACTION AND MOVE EVY
phBUpBr1hSo_7	AH AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY TRUE AH I THINK THE SECOND RUBY AND THE THIRD RUBY ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR AH I THINK THEY TRY TO ADD A LOT OF HEART
Ci-AH39fi3Y_8	BUT IT WAS STILL REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD AND
lXPQBPVc5Cw_10	I'M IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOVIES WHERE MOST OF THE FUNNY PARTS ARE IN THE COMMERCIAL SO YOU'RE LIKE THAT WHEN HE HAS TO BE OFF SOME AND YOU GO AND YOU DON'T YOU SEE THE COMMERCIAL IS ON ACCOUNT OF THAT PART OF THE NEW FUN ANY MORE AND THEN YOU'RE WONDERING WHERE THE HELL IS THE REST OF IT IS
QN9ZIUWUXsY_11	AH THE DIRECTION IS A BIT IT'S WOBBLY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_6	THOUGH I GUESS I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT IT TURNED OUT AS GOOD AS IT DID BECAUSE
atnd_PF-Lbs_14	THERE ARE ABOUT TWO KINDS OF SEEDS IN HERE AH ONE BEING IN INTESTINAL JOURNEY THROUGH THE RECTUM IN A SWIMMING POOL DRAIN AND ATTIRE DECAPITATION THAT
MLal-t_vJPM_5	IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST THING APPARENTLY IN THEATERS
Nzq88NnDkEk_25	AND FOR MY REVIEW I MEAN TO SAY I MEAN TO GIVE A TWO THUMBS DOWN RELEASE THE
iiK8YX8oH1E_8	I THINK IT'S PREDICTABLE UP TO A POINT
6_0THN4chvY_10	I'LL THAT'S PROBABLY THE PART IN THE TRAILER THAT GOT ME TO SEE THE MULEY
G6GlGvlkxAQ_24	I'M THE OSTROG OF THE BILL IN THE BACK STORY OF JANE FOSTER PLAYED BY NOW THE PORTMAN AND HER CREW AND HOW THEY RELATE THE FORT
nbWiPyCm4g0_2	IT REACHED NEW HEIGHTS OF SURRENDERS
8OtFthrtaJM_7	THINKS A LOT COMMERCIAL
wMbj6ajWbic_1	I REALLY WANT TO SEE IT ACTUALLY BUT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_19	YOU DON'T WHY WHAT IS THE MISSION
etzxEpPuc6I_2	BUT DO THEY MAKE THE TECHNOLOGIES AND I CAN'T BRING THEM OVER
IumbAb8q2dM_22	SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU GO AS OURS IS REALLY
03bSnISJMiM_13	AND IT'S REALLY FUNNY
ob23OKe5a9Q_10	HOW IS IT TO BE
OQvJTdtJ2H4_1	COULD BE BETTER
HEsqda8_d0Q_33	WANTED TO PUT THIS UP SOON
7JsX8y1ysxY_3	SO REALLY SUCKY ACTING
9J25DZhivz8_11	AH I COULD I COULDN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT WAS ROSS
73jzhE8R1TQ_18	POLLY DON'T THINK SO BUT YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT I DO FOR SOME REASON YOU KNOW ME
f9O3YtZ2VfI_15	SCALE IT DOWN LIKE TWO HOURS
VbQk4H8hgr0_16	AND HE WASN'T EVEN THAT GREATEST TIME ROUND
ob23OKe5a9Q_12	IT WAS GREATLY EASY AND I WONDERED
HEsqda8_d0Q_9	WHAT A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
cXypl4FnoZo_5	UM I LIKED IT I THOUGHT CATHERINE HENWICK DID A GOOD JOB
_dI--eQ6qVU_4	BUT JUST GOING INTO THIS AS AN OBSERVER AND SOME ONE WHO WAS NO IDEA IT WAS A FACT HAS TO FILL IT WITH SO MUCH FUN
d6hH302o4v8_37	BORING'S
cXypl4FnoZo_14	I'M I JUST I WOULDN'T LIKE ME AND WE WERE SAYING WE WERE THINKING THE WHOLE TIME LIKE WHO COULD IT BE TO BE
8d-gEyoeBzc_10	BUT I AM I WOULD SAY THAT I AM THERE IS AT LEAST GOOD THOSE VULGAR CHARACTERS IN THERE ARE
cXypl4FnoZo_11	AH AND YET I WOULD SUGGEST YOU COULD SEE IT IF YOU WERE LIKE THINKING ABOUT SEEING IT BUT YOU WEREN'T SURE IF IT WOULD BE WORTH SEEING
ZUXBRvtny7o_32	ONLY TO GO WITH FRIENDS ALONE WITH FAMILY TO WATCH THAT RAINY DAY AND IF YOU CAN WATCH IT AT A HALF BRYCE AT A MIDNIGHT SOWING
GWuJjcEuzt8_18	YOU HAVE MONEY TO SPEND GO AHEAD
d3_k5Xpfmik_18	IT'S ALMOST LIKE A IMAGINE OF TERRANTINO DIRECTED AS I'M BEMUVIAL
5W7Z1C_fDaE_18	BEING RELEASED IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY
_dI--eQ6qVU_12	BUT THE HUMOR REALLY JUST KNEELED IN
VbQk4H8hgr0_54	IT WAS A WORTH THAT IT MIGHT BE ME TO GO SEE SO
cXypl4FnoZo_21	AND WE WISHED THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PETER BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE AND THAT AH PETER
OQvJTdtJ2H4_4	IT WAS VERY HARD TO FOLLOW
d3_k5Xpfmik_3	THE CLASH OF PERSONALITY IS REALLY IN KARA'S MOUTH AND DYNAMIC AND E
aiEXnCPZubE_28	CANDY IN DIS
8qrpnFRGt2A_1	AND I BELIEVE THAT I WAS WATCHING THIS I PURPOSELY PUT IT ON BECAUSE I FEARED IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE STUPID THAT I COULD FALL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF AND NOT MISS TOO MUCH
Bfr499ggo-0_8	AND THEY KIND OF LOOKED LIKE CLOWNS THE SINGERS ONE OF THEM
9qR7uwkblbs_24	IT IS KEN OFT SAID BUT THAT THE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_15	THE LADY WHO PLAYS DRESSING TO MY LADY'S SISTER I THINK SHE'S VERY GOOD AND THIS WILL BE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_3	IT WAS REALLY BORING FOR ME
9qR7uwkblbs_20	SHE REALLY ACTED LIKE ME AT ALL
9qR7uwkblbs_29	LIKE WHAT A FROCK LIKE THAT'S WHAT I'M GOOD AT
tStelxIAHjw_9	BUT IT WAS CUTE
ZUXBRvtny7o_25	I WILL EVEN BE KEPT ONLY ON GLORYING AH
d3_k5Xpfmik_5	ZAMELAND IS A REALLY SUCCESSFUL FOR A COMEDY AS
bvLlb-M3UXU_16	THIS MADE ME FEEL DEPRESSED
nzpVDcQ0ywM_11	ALL I CAN SAY IS HE'S A PRETTY AVERAGE GUY
tStelxIAHjw_13	TWO OUT OF FIVE STARS
BI97DNYfe5I_15	HE'S A GREAT JOB
f_pcplsH_V0_9	I HAIN'T BEEN THREATENED BUT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_20	AND THE SAME THING HAS MORE OR LESS HAPPENED HERE YES THAT'S RIGHT
d6hH302o4v8_18	THEY CARE ABOUT IT AT ALL
nzpVDcQ0ywM_13	MARLINE WYAN'S KIND OF PLAYS A WATERDOWN VERSION OF HIMSELF FROM OTHER MOVIES
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_11	MEN IN TIGHTS SWITCHED NO HILARIOUS PROOF OF THE STORY
1iG0909rllw_11	THING IS IT'S A VERY GOOD TRANSLATION OF THE BOOK
POKffnXeBds_2	DON'T GET AROUND KATE HUDSON IS A PRETTY FINE LOOKING BUT I JUST THINK IT'S KIND OF STUPID I WON'T SAY SHE HAS A FAT ASH
rnaNMUZpvvg_12	AND THEN THERE'S HIS LITTLE BOY AND HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO WASN'T
2iD-tVS8NPw_26	AND IF HE'S ABLE TO DO ALL THIS SORT OF STUFF LIKE HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE TO REALLY PUT UP A FORCE THAT CAN PUSH HIM TO THE NEXT LEVEL OR OR DESTROY HIM AT THE SAME TIME
Oz06ZWiO20M_14	I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND SILLY BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BROAD GOOFY MAIN STREAM COLT KIND OF MOVIE BUT
d6hH302o4v8_42	ON THE WAY I SAW IT
POKffnXeBds_10	I MEAN HER ACTING IT LIKE SO SO AND I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE EVEN ONE OSCAR BELIEVES SHE WANTS HER OR FOR A BESS SUPPORTING ACTRESS OR BEST ACTRESS SOMETHING
6_0THN4chvY_4	I'M THE GREAT KING'S TOOL
d6hH302o4v8_9	HE WAS VERY ANNOYING
c7UH_rxdZv4_13	I'M JUST THE JACKASS
lXPQBPVc5Cw_2	I'M NOT GOING TO LIE HERE IT WASN'T GOOD
LSi-o-IrDMs_8	IS THAT SO O KAA
2iD-tVS8NPw_13	IT IS PERFECT FOR KIDS AS WELL AS JUST LIKE TWO AGES AS WELL WHO JUST WANT TO SEE A LOT OF EXPLOSIONS AND SOME CRAZY STUFF AND
iiK8YX8oH1E_11	SO I'LL GIVE IT POINTS FOR NOT BEING EXACTLY LIKE MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING EVEN IF THE TRAILER SETS IT UP THAT WAY
zhpQhgha_KU_7	ADD A FEW FUNNY PARTS
cM3Yna7AavY_7	WAS INCREDIBLE SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT COLORED PALLETS SMOOTH AND DRAWN ANIMATION YOU DON'T
9T9Hf74oK10_24	YOU DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
bOL9jKpeJRs_20	I'M NOT REALLY EXCITED WHEN I TOLD YOU WE WERE GETTING A WEEK'S SPENT
HEsqda8_d0Q_23	I'VE CHOSEN TO GO AND SEE THAT
pLTX3ipuDJI_8	WHAT DISAPPOINTED ME WAS THAT ONE OF THE MOST HIGH STAFFS IN THE MOVIE WAS ONLY IN IT FOR A SHORT TIME AT A TIME
Jkswaaud0hk_7	SOME SCENES WHERE I THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN GET TO FEEL MORE OF THE EMOTION OF IT
LSi-o-IrDMs_22	AND IT MAKES IT WORTH GOING TO SEE THIS MOVING IF YOU'VE GOT A THE THEY'LL BE THREE SOMEWHERE NEAR AND NEAR TO TOWN
BvYR0L6f2Ig_5	SO IT WAS JUST ABOUT EQUAL TO THE FIRST ONE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_27	I TELL YOU I COULDN'T GET ALL THAT RUBY HERE FAST ENOUGH
9J25DZhivz8_12	I KEPT I WAS LISTENING FOR IT
0h-zjBukYpk_16	OH I DON'T THINK WE THREE WERE IS A GOOD ACTOR
c5xsKMxpXnc_7	THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE FOR THESE REASONS
VCslbP0mgZI_17	IF I DON'T GIVE HIS HONOUR THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
vyB00TXsimI_16	THERE'S A SCENE IN A CAVE WHERE THEY FIGHT A GIANT MONSTER THAT REALLY REMINDS ME OF LIKE SOME SORT OF LORD OF THE RINGS MINDS OF MIRIAM A MOMENT
Njd1F0vZSm4_4	AND THE OWLS ARE REALLY WONDERFUL
9T9Hf74oK10_5	IT WAS A PRETTY SLOW MOVIE FOR THE MOST PART
vyB00TXsimI_21	I LAUGHED AT QUITE A BIT OF THE DIALOGUE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_18	THEY WEREN'T YOU KNOW INTRODUCED WELL REALLY
d6hH302o4v8_1	THIS MOVING WAS HORRIBLE
VbQk4H8hgr0_55	I ONLY SUGGEST
c7UH_rxdZv4_23	IT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS ANY GOOD WHATSOEVER
Njd1F0vZSm4_6	THEY DO HAVE VERY NICE PERSONALITIES AND
Sqr0AcuoNnk_11	BUT IT HAD A LOT OF BAD MOMENTS
cW1FSBF59ik_16	ERIC I LOVE SEDUCED IN THIS WAY
Nzq88NnDkEk_8	AND BEING A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL I WAS I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE HIM BUT
wMbj6ajWbic_30	JEHOVAH'S HOUSE INTERNATIONAL AT WHAT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_17	I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING I WENT WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS AND A MOVIE HAS TO BE TEN TIMES BETTER WHEN YOU'RE WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS
PZ-lDQFboO8_11	LIKE ANTS
VbQk4H8hgr0_9	THERE WAS A FEW JOKES O K OUT TO MAKE YOU GIGGLE OR SOMETHING BUT
cW1FSBF59ik_15	OVER IN THE DITCH THE RANDOM BITS THE WOBBLING OF A KICKER'S BONE THE WHITE MARBLE WINDING SISS ON TORTURING
nzpVDcQ0ywM_12	I DON'T REALLY FEEL ANY EMOTIONAL PULL FROM HIM IN THIS MOVIE
9qR7uwkblbs_10	AND YOU SHOULD ALL GO OUT AND SEE IT AND YOU KNOW STOP
_dI--eQ6qVU_5	AND I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IT WAS HILARIOUS
8OtFthrtaJM_16	AH YOU KNOW IT HAD SOME INTERESTING WRITING
f9O3YtZ2VfI_2	A VERY INTERESTING IDEA AND
TvyZBvOMOTc_12	AND BOTH THE AFTERS AMY ADAMS AND MATTHEW GOOD WERE WELL WITH EACH OTHER AND
2iD-tVS8NPw_20	I THINK THERE IS ALSO SOMETHING LIKE A TONE WITHIN THE ACTUAL POWERS OF THE GREENLANDER HIMSELF AND THAT HE CAN HASTILY THINK OF ANYTHING AND THAT HE CAN PROJECT THAT INTO THE REAL LIFE
8d-gEyoeBzc_16	OF WHICH SHE WAS ANOTHER WELL DRAWN OUT CHARACTER
nzpVDcQ0ywM_19	AND HIS PERFORMANCE IS CAMPING AND COMES OFF AS AN ARMY CHEER LEADER SOME OF THE TIME
Bfr499ggo-0_14	SO THOUGHT THE DESERT RIDING THE CAMELS ALL TRAPPED UP LOOKING LIKE CLOWNS
cM3Yna7AavY_1	I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE MOVIE THEATERS TO GO SEE UNDER THE EYE OF BEEN WAITING PROBABLY ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF TO TWO YEARS AGO
POKffnXeBds_9	AND HALF THE WAY IS REALLY OVERRATED IN MY OPINION
PZ-lDQFboO8_9	I MAY BE BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME DREAM WORDS BUT FOR THIS ONE FOR ME IT IS WASN'T ALL I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE
OtBXNcAL_lE_20	UM YES ANYWAYS IT'S REALLY PREDICTABLE
9qR7uwkblbs_9	I CAN SPOIL ANYTHING FOR YOU JUST BECAUSE LIKE THAT WOULD BE RUDE
7JsX8y1ysxY_11	CATALOGUED
c7UH_rxdZv4_29	HE SEEMED TO HAVE GENUINE AFFECTION FOR OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
Sqr0AcuoNnk_4	AND THERE ARE TIMES THAT I WAS JUST SITTING THERE AFTER THEY SAID THEIR JOKES AND I WAS LIKE THAT'S NOT NOBODY IS LAUGHING THAT'S NOTHING
iiK8YX8oH1E_16	I DON'T USUALLY LIKE
zhpQhgha_KU_23	IT'S JUST ABOUT GETTING GETTING TIME FOR YOURSELF AND
Bfr499ggo-0_3	BUT IF YOU LOVE THE THEORIES AND YOU ALSO LIKE THEMSELVES THE FIRST WILL BE THAT YOU LIVE IN A HAPPY TIME
5W7Z1C_fDaE_8	AND REALLY WELL DONE
POKffnXeBds_11	I MEAN THAT MOVING WAS A WASTE OF TIME
1DmNV9C1hbY_7	AND THE WHILE THE TRAITOR MADE THE FILM LOOK REAL NICE AND CUTE
LSi-o-IrDMs_15	HAD IDEAL SEED'S
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_13	IT IS LACKED THE CHARM OF THOSE PAST MOVIES
G6GlGvlkxAQ_12	THE PRIMEVAL HAD A KIND OF BOOK SHOWS AND MOVIES
wMbj6ajWbic_26	QUAY I THINK HAD A LOT OF FUN
1DmNV9C1hbY_8	THERE WAS A FLAT
zhpQhgha_KU_26	THEY ARE LIKE THE LIGHT OF THE ISSUES
jUzDDGyPkXU_19	IN THIS MOVIE IS CLEVERLY WRITTEN EVERYTHING
0h-zjBukYpk_4	THAT LIKE TO SEE COMICAL CHARACTERS TREATED RESPONSIBLELY
Oz06ZWiO20M_23	IN THE CARRIAGES THERE ARE OTHERS PLACE HOLDERS
vvZ4IcEtiZc_2	I THOUGHT THAT THE PERFORMANCES IN IT WERE INCREDIBLE
6Egk_28TtTM_12	BUT IT ALL TURNS OUT GREAT IN THE END
d6hH302o4v8_25	NO SENSE OF IT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_5	THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S ALL TOLD IN FLASH BACK FROM A POINT JUST BEFORE CATRINA HITS NEW ORLEANS
OtBXNcAL_lE_19	IT'S HIM THAT WANTS TO BE A BLAB LAUGHED ANOTHER OF THE OTHERS
G-xst2euQUc_13	IF IT WAS ANN HATHAWAY HE DID THE SINGING SHE DID A GREAT JOB
9J25DZhivz8_14	BUT OTHERWISE I THOUGHT HE WAS EXCELLENT AS FOR THREE D I
8qrpnFRGt2A_10	AH THIS MOONEY THIS MOONEY AND BY HALF WAY THROUGH I WAS CHECKING THE TIME AND SAW THAT THIS MOON WAS TWO HOURS LONG
7JsX8y1ysxY_12	A CLASSIC SIB A HERO CAT GET IN ALL KINDS OF THING
atnd_PF-Lbs_11	NOW LET US GET INTO THE TWO THINGS THAT WILL POSSIBLY ATTRACT YOU TO THIS FILM THE VIOLENCE I'M AFRAID OF YOURS
zhpQhgha_KU_33	YOU DO WANT TO SEE SOMEBODY WHO IS POSITIVELY PARTAKING IT ALL
Clx4VXItLTE_3	I DO JUMP THERE
VbQk4H8hgr0_42	THAT'S PIECEMEAL MORE BUT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_18	IS WHAT
atnd_PF-Lbs_17	I MEAN NOT TO SEEK LIKE ALL MY GOD THAT WAS ALSO
9J25DZhivz8_2	THIS REALLY IS JUST TOO ADORABLE
Clx4VXItLTE_18	BUT I'M IT WAS TO ME AND I
LSi-o-IrDMs_3	SHE'S NOT FIND THE SERIES TO BE VERY FUN AND POP CORN AND GOT A RUBY
Oz06ZWiO20M_25	THE STORY OF SWAN LAKE ISN'T WHAT PEOPLES HE'S LIKE IT'S THE MOVEMENT AND THE DANCING AND THE MUSIC AND THE SETS AND OF THE EXPERIENCE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_23	WHITE SEQUENCES ARE PRETTY NEAT
k5Y_838nuGo_28	YOU HAVE ME LAUGHIN OUT LOUD
LSi-o-IrDMs_6	THE ACTING IS BAD THE
Oz06ZWiO20M_17	SO IT'S LIKE PUT SOME PEOPLE IN IT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH HER
0h-zjBukYpk_21	SHE LIKED HIM ALIVE
bvLlb-M3UXU_6	NOT A COMPLICATED STORY BUT
pLTX3ipuDJI_3	ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T THE SAME WAS THE CONNEXION TO EACH OTHER WHICH THE FIRST MAY BE HAD AND THIS ONE LAUGHED
rnaNMUZpvvg_13	BUT HE WASN'T EVEN INTERESTING
9qR7uwkblbs_12	AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE OO OO OO OO LIKE Z DOWN ON HIM AND I'M JUST LIKE SITTIN HERE LIKE ANNIE'S MOTHER I CAN DRAW
BI97DNYfe5I_4	AH BUT IT WAS STILL A GOOD FILM
HEsqda8_d0Q_29	IT'S NOT MY FAVORITE FROM EVER
Nzq88NnDkEk_15	AND I'D THINK THEY'D MADE HER ALMOST LOOK TOO AND I TRIED TO YOU'LL MAKE HER LOOK TOO BEAUTIFUL
1DmNV9C1hbY_4	IT REMINDS ME OF GETTING UP ON A SATURDAY MORNING AND EATING FRUIT AND THE WASHING CARTOONS
6Egk_28TtTM_10	I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I SAW HE WASN'T REALLY'S KIND OF SCARED
6_0THN4chvY_6	HE'S GOT GREAT JOKES
POKffnXeBds_8	AND SHE MIGHT LIKE YOU BUT EVEN THEN IS NOT REALLY FUNNY AT ALL
VbQk4H8hgr0_33	I MEAN THERE IS A FEW MOMENTS TO YOU THAT ARE ORIGINAL ONLY TO YOU
Af8D0E4ZXaw_3	AND PUT THEM IN A JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVING WITH THE RIGHT TO A BAD MAN AND SUPERMAN
atnd_PF-Lbs_1	IT'S BAD
7JsX8y1ysxY_1	GRAPHICS WERE INCREDIBLE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_12	AT THE HOME OF THE HOUSE YOU KNOW THINKING THIS ISN'T AS BAD AS I'VE HEARD AND IT WASN'T
Af8D0E4ZXaw_8	SAY THAT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE SOME ONE OWES YOU AN APOLOGY
BioHAh1qJAQ_29	FOR SOME KIND OF FREAKY TELEPORTATION OR WHATEVER
HEsqda8_d0Q_10	AND IT'S ALL KIND OF IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN
VbQk4H8hgr0_45	AND NOT AT ALL ORIGINAL IN MY OPINION
OQvJTdtJ2H4_2	FIRST ONE KNOWS A LOT BETTER
POKffnXeBds_6	ALL THE FUNNY PARTS WEREN'T
nbWiPyCm4g0_3	THIS MAY BE ISN'T JUST BAD IT'S DIABOLICAL
Bfr499ggo-0_7	YOU CAN'T GET AT IT WITH A BUMP WAY OVER THE TOP
cXypl4FnoZo_19	AH BUT YET WHENEVER I HE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HIM BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SHOWING HIM A LOT BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH TIT THEY CAN'T BE LIKE ALL WITH HIM HE ENDED
Ci-AH39fi3Y_16	AND A PRETTY SURE THAT'S BECAUSE IT DIDN'T TAKE TO THE MOVING IT ALL SO
9qR7uwkblbs_11	THE BEST PART OF THE BUCCANE ASKED MOVIE WAS THIS ONE SCENE WHERE A WINEGLASS WAS JUST STANDING THERE IN A FORKING SUIT EATING PEAS UP IN SLOW ASS MOTION
Ci-AH39fi3Y_40	I'LL SMACK HIM IN THE FACE FOR THE OTHER IRRELEVANT FLATLY
bOL9jKpeJRs_4	THE CHARACTERS WERE SO GREAT WANTS OF ELLA
jUzDDGyPkXU_15	ENOUGH THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A GOOD REASON WHETHER WHY THEY ARE ATTACKING AND
cW1FSBF59ik_19	NOTICING THEM AND ANYTHING ELSE
G-xst2euQUc_4	IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN PRODUCTION COMPANIES START PUSHING MOVIES THAT FAR AHEAD OF WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE RELEASED THAT USUALLY MEANS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE GREAT
I5y0__X72p0_6	AND ALL THE PEOPLE WALKED OUT OF THE THEATRE AND BEYOND THE TRAILER REALLY LIKED IT SO
f9O3YtZ2VfI_23	THEY DID A LOT OF GOOD THINGS WITH IT
wMbj6ajWbic_7	THE ACTINGS A LITTLE ROUGH IN SOME PARTS OF THE
k5Y_838nuGo_14	MAYBE IT'S BREAKING IN THE BABY OGRE'S REALLY BROUGHT IT DOWN
ZAIRrfG22O0_7	IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT TYPE OF MOVIE THEN I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS AT ALL
bvLlb-M3UXU_11	AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL'S THAT ALL WE NEED TO DO
Jkswaaud0hk_16	I DO THINK IT'S WORTH SAYING
POKffnXeBds_1	CAN I SAY I AM CURIOUS
8qrpnFRGt2A_8	AH AND AGAIN I IF I'D BEEN PAYING CLOSER ATTENTION I MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED IT MORE AND
9T9Hf74oK10_13	THOSE THREE ARE SOME OF THE BEST YOUNG ACTORS OF TO DAY
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_4	I'M BUT I DARESAY MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE LOWERED BY HIS OTHER REVIEWS I READ BUT
tIrG4oNLFzE_5	SO I WENT INTO THE STORE AND HAVING QUITE HIGH EXPECTATIONS
bOL9jKpeJRs_33	USUALLY THE GLOSSY EXPENDITURE
ZUXBRvtny7o_10	ISN'T THAT THE SORT OF A THING
yDtzw_Y-7RU_17	MOST LIKELY FROM GOING VERY QUICKLY THROUGH LONDON WITH YOU KNOW DEMON HORSES CHASING YOU SO AND THERE'S THAT
cXypl4FnoZo_25	AND ANOTHER THING THE OTHER GUY SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO MARRY WAS A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER LOOKING THAN PETER
1iG0909rllw_26	THEN MOMENTS ON SCREENS WERE SCARCE AND THERE WERE REALLY ONES IN A LOT WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS FINE AND WAS REALLY RATHER GOOD
7JsX8y1ysxY_9	HE WAS FOLLOWED UP
OtBXNcAL_lE_11	AND DON'T GET IT WRONG THERE WERE YOU KNOW FUNNY PARTS IN THE MOVIE
VbQk4H8hgr0_22	I WAS JUST SO DISCOURAGED AFTER SEEING THAT WOULD BE
73jzhE8R1TQ_1	I'M SORRY THINKS I'LL GIVE UP THE MOVIE BETTER THAN I LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK AND VICE VERSA
G-xst2euQUc_20	HOW MUCH I REALLY DID ENJOY IT SO I WOULD
tIrG4oNLFzE_10	EXPRESSIONS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM IT WAS LIKE IT IS LIKE POUTY
ob23OKe5a9Q_9	THE ESSAYS I HAVE BEEN HERE IN THE THEATER AND THEY WERE LYING IN THE RHYMES AND THE ESSAYS AND THE ESSAYS AND THE ESSAYS AND THE ESSAYS
bOL9jKpeJRs_25	OH IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD
k5Y_838nuGo_10	I DID LIKE THE FIRST ONE QUITE A BIT
bvLlb-M3UXU_19	PRESENTLY HE WAS ALONE AND KNOWING THAT THESE GUYS AREN'T IN THE SHAPE THEY WERE TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO
HEsqda8_d0Q_30	BUT WITH DEATH YOU WATCH AGAIN
f_pcplsH_V0_8	THINK IT'S HOW IT UNDERRATED
BioHAh1qJAQ_22	THE LAWYERS JUST PULLED THIS OUT OF THEIR ASS
9J25DZhivz8_17	AND SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT THERE'S LOT OF CHEAP TRICKS
jUzDDGyPkXU_3	VERY REMINISCENT OF DISTRICT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_34	IT PRETTY MUCH JUST LEFT THE DOOR WIDE OPEN FOR SOME SIX WHICH OBVIOUSLY
zhpQhgha_KU_10	I I MEAN IF YOU REALLY LIKE TO SHOW WHEN YOU REALLY LIKED TO THE FIRST MOVE ME AND YOU SO WANT TO GO SEE THAT I DON'T WANT NOTHIN TO DISCOURAGE YOU FROM SAYING IT
c5xsKMxpXnc_6	DEY LEFT A LOT O CLOCK HOLES
BioHAh1qJAQ_18	ALL THOSE ACTIONS SENSING AND INVOLVING THE GAMES WERE AGREED TO WATCH THE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_20	THE WHOLE TIME I SAW HER ALL I SAW WAS HELEN HUNT AND VERNON'S AWAY
f9O3YtZ2VfI_29	BUT IT'S PASSED
HEsqda8_d0Q_2	FROM HERE ITSELF WAS REALLY COOL
cM3Yna7AavY_13	I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE BUT FATHER BHAER
2WGyTLYerpo_54	JUST THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF STUPID
BXuRRbG0Ugk_23	AND NOW THAT I'VE SEEN HIM IN THE ROLE I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY OTHER CURRENT ACTOR TRYING TO PULL IT OFF HE
0h-zjBukYpk_3	MY REASON I'M A COMIC BOOK FAN
IumbAb8q2dM_3	PRISCILLA FROM THE READABLES GIVEN SUCH A GOOD REVIEW
6Egk_28TtTM_8	AND IT DEPENDS WHAT AIDS YOU ARE AND HOW YOU TO HOW YOU FEAT LIKE SEEMINGLY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_4	THERE WAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL LEFT ON THE TABLE
9c67fiY0wGQ_6	I ALSO THOUGHT SOME PARTS OF THE MOVING WERE FUNNY FOR EXAMPLE ON THE GORGO'S CAT'S FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
v0zCBqDeKcE_13	IF YOU'RE I'M A LOVER JIM CARROLL OVER YOU AND BIGGER THAN YOU'LL LIKE THIS AND BE
2iD-tVS8NPw_24	BUT THEN YOU COME LIKE WALK OUT OF THE MOVING LIKE WOOL I I GUESS WHAT HAPPENED I UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED BUT
2WGyTLYerpo_19	BUT ONE THING I LIKE WITH THE ALIENS IS THAT THEY ARE NOT LIKE WEAKLINGS THAT HIDE BEHIND THEIR TECHNOLOGY
ZUXBRvtny7o_6	I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MORNING
lXPQBPVc5Cw_25	OH I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF CHECKING THE TIME FOR THAT AS WHEN IS THIS MOVIE GOING TO END
Bfr499ggo-0_1	MOST OF THE CRITICS ARE RIGHT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_23	I ENJOYED MYSELF IN IT YOU MIGHT AS WELL I
VCslbP0mgZI_8	BUT HERE'S THE ESSENTIALS MOVING THE ESSENTIALS MOVING WELL MAYBE THIS WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT UP THERE IS A A COMEDIAN NAMED DAVE CHIP HELL'S A AND DAVE CHIP HELL'S A N AND ANOTHER COMEDYUMS ROCK ARE OF THE AMERICANS AND IN THEIR COMEDY THEY SOMETIMES TAKE ON AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE A CAN AMERICAN CULTURE AND SO THEY WILL MAKE FUN OF BLACK PEOPLE AND THE THING
c7UH_rxdZv4_10	SOMETHING THAT'S JUST KIND OF MAKE SOME SORTS SLIGHTLY ENDEARING EVEN THOUGH A KIND OF JACKASS YOU KNOW YOU'RE
Clx4VXItLTE_1	AND IT IS JUMPY FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE DON'T SCARED OR JUMPED ME OR ANYTHING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_21	I'M AND IN FACT IN SPITE OF ALL THE NEGATIVES UNDER LET'S MENTION I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS WORKING FOR A WHILE FOR ABOUT THE FIRST THIRD BUT AT THE END OF ACT ONE TWO SIGNIFICANT THINGS HAPPENED HECTOR HAMMOND ARRIVES
ZUXBRvtny7o_31	THE MAKE UP OF CHARACTERS MAKE THIS WILL BE A REALLY GOOD MORNING
MLal-t_vJPM_10	I HAVE TWO PROBLEMS WITH IT
G-xst2euQUc_15	ANYWAY I'M I'LL RECOMMEND IT IF YOU LIKE ME AND YOU DON'T NORMALLY GO TO SEE ANIMATED MOVIES
Oz06ZWiO20M_15	IT REALLY HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH A MUSICAL OR AN OPERA OR EVEN A BALLET THAN A REGULAR NARRATIVE FILM IS LIKE
1iG0909rllw_20	THE SCRIPT IT LEFT ALL THE KEY PLOTS AND EMOTION FROM THE CHARACTERS TO BE EXPOSED THROUGH DIALOGUE
I5y0__X72p0_28	IT WAS IT DID ADD TO THE MOVIE THOUGH AND
G6GlGvlkxAQ_5	ADDING TO THE CANNIBAL CHRIS HAS GOT TO BE IN A BIGGER STAR
bOL9jKpeJRs_30	AND THAT
atnd_PF-Lbs_7	BUT AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THIS SERIES IS GARBAGE
VbQk4H8hgr0_53	VERY FEW N
OtBXNcAL_lE_12	DON'T CARE FOR THE PLOT
HEsqda8_d0Q_13	SOMETIMES THREE DAY ISN'T REALLY THAT COULD
wMbj6ajWbic_28	SO AT THE I THINK IT WAS COO EE AS THE GREAT PARK IN ACTION GREAT ACTION STARED
aiEXnCPZubE_6	SPECIALLY STUNNING
VbQk4H8hgr0_31	AND OVER ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WAS NOT GREAT
7JsX8y1ysxY_18	BUT SHE ACTS LIKE A POWER RANGER
OtBXNcAL_lE_7	I REALLY DON'T CARE TO SEE THOSE
cXypl4FnoZo_20	I'M I I WISH WE WISH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN I'M THE GUY
ZUXBRvtny7o_15	YOU MUSTN'T FEEL AT BOTH OF THEM MOLLY
wMbj6ajWbic_8	YOU KNOW THAT CORNY BUT
rnaNMUZpvvg_17	OR ARE YOU KILLING EVERY ONE
phBUpBr1hSo_14	THIS ONE SEEMED LONG AT SOME AND SOME PARTS AND SOME
VbQk4H8hgr0_6	I WENT IN THERE HOPING TO SEE SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND FUNNY LIKE THE FIRST TWO IN A
Nzq88NnDkEk_1	WHICH IS A REBUT I GUESS WOULD BE THE BEST TERM FOR THE BLUE WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE MOVING CLASHES ENDS
VbQk4H8hgr0_8	WERE MOWGLI FUNNY
9c67fiY0wGQ_7	THERE'S SO HILARIOUS AND SOME ONE TO HELP A PERSON WITHOUT AH
I5y0__X72p0_22	I'M I I'D AT THE END OF MOVING THE FRIENDS I WAS WITH ALONE GIRLS WAS THERE A PLOT TO THIS MOVIE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_1	YES WHEN YOU HEAR JOHNNY'S DEATH YOU THINK THIS MAY BE HAS TO BE GOOD
Af8D0E4ZXaw_22	STARTS TO SCENERY LIKE IT'S TWO DOLLARS STEAK
BXuRRbG0Ugk_22	HE'S PLAYING A VARIATION OF THE ICONIC MAN WITH NO NAMED CHARACTER THAT WAS MADE FAMOUS BY CLINT EASTWOOD
VbQk4H8hgr0_47	THE SECOND YEAR WAS REALLY GREAT
VbQk4H8hgr0_50	IF SHE REALLY BE ONE
VCslbP0mgZI_7	ACTUALLY HAVE SOME FANATICALLY HASN'T COOL THEMES ABOUT HEROISM AND ABOUT BY TAKING OWNERSHIP OF YOURSELF AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH I RESONATED WITH AN EYE IN WHICH I APPRECIATED
2iD-tVS8NPw_1	BEFORE I WENT IN TO SEE THE GREENLANDS ARE I'VE BEEN HERE AND ALL THESE LIKE CRITICS SPACIOUSLY JUST TRASH IN THIS MOVIE LEFT AND RIGHT ANIMALS
f_pcplsH_V0_3	YOU'RE BACK TOO YOU HAVING TWO KILLERS THANKFULLY
rnaNMUZpvvg_5	AH IT WASN'T EVEN HOLDING MY ATTENTION I
2WGyTLYerpo_39	FIRST HE'S COME LIKE A GRUMPY OLD GUY BUT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_7	I DON'T NEED IT ALL COLD AND FLASHING
Nzq88NnDkEk_6	BUT AS THE TRAILERS CAME OUT I I REALLY LIKED WHAT I WAS SEEING
9qR7uwkblbs_3	SO THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY LIKE BAD SHIP
Af8D0E4ZXaw_7	ALL THE GREEN LANTERN FANS OUT THERE I AM SO SORRY
QN9ZIUWUXsY_4	I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOUR LEGACY IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE
GWuJjcEuzt8_2	WHY I SEE THAT IT IS BECAUSE SHE'S GOT A CRAZY GREEDY BOYS
BvYR0L6f2Ig_20	BUT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES I HAVE SEEN AT FIRST
d6hH302o4v8_14	I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT IS KILLED AT ALL WHO'S
v0zCBqDeKcE_14	NO PLEASE I WON'T LOUISE
VbQk4H8hgr0_17	THE DONKEY AND PUSSY BOOTS RIVALRY THAT'S GOING ON IT JUST IT WASN'T AS FUNNY THE THIRD TIME AROUND
9qR7uwkblbs_6	THEY WERE LIKE RACHEL WHITEHURST IN SOME BOOK AND FAT MATERIAL
G6GlGvlkxAQ_26	DIDN'T BELABOR THORN EARTH
ZUXBRvtny7o_34	SOYA IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN THIS WEEK END THOUGH WON'T YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE
OtBXNcAL_lE_24	GETS SO TIRED OF UNPREDICTABLE MOVIES LIKE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_4	SO NOT ONLY DID THIS MOVIE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BURDEN OF TELLING ITS OWN SELF CONTAINED STORY AND SETTING UP ITS OWN INEVITABLE SEQUELS
MLal-t_vJPM_6	IT IS IT'S A GREAT STORY
1DmNV9C1hbY_10	CAN'T YOU GET TO LOVE THE FELLOW
2WGyTLYerpo_3	I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GO AND SEE WHEN YOU GO OFF INTO A MOVIE CALLED COWBOY'S NAILINGS
MLal-t_vJPM_8	IT'S BEAUTIFULLY DONE
d6hH302o4v8_11	I WAS LISTENING TO SLEEPING
BioHAh1qJAQ_1	BECAUSE I AM A BIG MAN AT THE FIRST TRIAL
ZAIRrfG22O0_1	KEEPER SAVE YOUR MONEY WAIT TILL COME DOWN ORIENTAL
9qR7uwkblbs_21	NAWSICANOVS SAID ABOUT IT
jUzDDGyPkXU_21	THE ONLY ACTOR WHO CAN REALLY SELL THE LINES IS A MAN AT CARDS
etzxEpPuc6I_12	SOME OF US IN OUR LIGHT
aiEXnCPZubE_29	AND JUST OVER ALL SUPERB
2WGyTLYerpo_49	BUT THEY'RE NOT HUGE GLARING FLAWS
8qrpnFRGt2A_19	I GUESS SIR BUT THE FUNNY THING IS SIR I MEAN IF I PLEASE THE SPITE AND DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT ABOUT IS MOVING IN IT UP HALF WAY LIKE IN IT
jUzDDGyPkXU_1	THE ACTION IS TAKEN ALSO
8qrpnFRGt2A_6	AH THE BIGGEST ONE IS THE C G I A FACTS WERE JUST TERRIBLE
v0zCBqDeKcE_1	SHALL I SAY THAT I LOVE YOU
9T9Hf74oK10_8	A LOT OF CRITICS SAID THAT IT RELIED TOO MUCH ON THE AUDIENCE TO EXPLORE THE THEMES IN THE FILM AND YOU KNOW RIGHTLY SO I GUESS IT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_17	AND SHE LOOKS LIKE RENAISS WEGGER AND HELEN HUNT FROM THE TWISTER MOVIE
atnd_PF-Lbs_18	SICK IN THE ALL MY GOD THAT WAS CRAZY THAT KIND OF SICK THEY'RE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_22	I CAN'T DO IT
WKA5OygbEKI_16	IT'S REALLY THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE IS LISTENING TO HIM A PULL OFF ALL THESE DIFFERENT VOICES
etzxEpPuc6I_19	HE WILL GET SHOT IN THE EYE YOU KNOW AND THAT'LL BE IT BUT PEOPLE CAN'T SHINE IN THE EYE AND THEN THAT THEY HADN'T BLOWED AND THEN SOME DO GET HIS TORSO CUT OPEN AND AND SOME DO HIS HAND OUT TO CAR HIS HEAD OUT BLOWN OFF AND FOR THE PEOPLE FINE AND JUMPING
7JsX8y1ysxY_23	THAT WAS VERY CRUEL
73jzhE8R1TQ_16	PETER LOOKED AT SOME OF THE RESULTS OF CORDIALS IN THAT ASPECT
W8NXH0Djyww_5	HAD ALL THE STEREOTYPICAL TRAITS OF A WESTERN TOWN
ZAIRrfG22O0_4	BUT AFTER AN HOUR I JUST SAID ENOUGH I HAD TO WALK OUT
I5y0__X72p0_36	WASN'T IT WASN'T USUAL
Jkswaaud0hk_8	THERE'S SOME FUNNY LINES
GWuJjcEuzt8_3	AND SHE'S REALLY REALLY WELL AND IS MOVING YOU KNOW
2iD-tVS8NPw_7	I WOULD ACTUALLY SAID THIS PROBLEM ON THE FIRST MOVES THIS YEAR BUT I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR THAT YOU'LL WANT TO SEE IN THREE DAYS ESPECIALLY FOR JUST THE OPENING PORTION
ZUXBRvtny7o_16	THE MAIN BONE OF THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT'S MORBID IT'S SO YOU SEE
rnaNMUZpvvg_7	I HONESTLY WANTED THE ALIENS TO WIN
cM3Yna7AavY_5	AND OH OH MY GOSH I WAS BLOWN AWAY
phBUpBr1hSo_15	PARTS JUST COME TO DRAGGED ON AND YOU CANDY AND I'LL SIT IN THE MOVIE THEATER AND THIS IS A BIG ACTION WILL BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVIES OF THE SUMMER AND YOU KIND OF JUST WANTED TO AND I REST YOUR HEAD WHILE YOU WATCHED I'M FOR SOME OF THE SEQUENCES AND SOME OF THE SCENES IT'S KIND OF LONG AND
phBUpBr1hSo_1	AND AT THIS MOODY VERY EARLY SAT UP
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_15	AND THAT I THINK IT WAS AN OKAY RUBY
Nzq88NnDkEk_9	TO ME SOME ONE NEEDS TO RELEASE THE CRACKING ON THIS MOVING AND IS TOTALLY DESTROYED BECAUSE
tmZoasNr4rU_7	I I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY THE HUMOR WENT WITH MULTI FLAT BECAUSE A FEW SEVERAL JOKES ACTUALLY FELT THAT THEY THAT YOU FELT FELT FUNNY
Qr1Ca94K55A_13	NO I DON'T REALLY RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU'VE GOIN TO DATE WITH THE GIRL
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_9	BUT PEOPLE COULD HAVE ABOUT THIS MOOD THERE ARE SOME NEGATIVES TO SAY THE LEAST
Vj1wYRQjB-o_3	IT'S PRETTY PRETTY SCARY LOOKING
BI97DNYfe5I_21	YOU ALAS
2WGyTLYerpo_21	REALLY STRONG
HEsqda8_d0Q_17	WAS ONE OF MY OTHER CONCERNS
vyB00TXsimI_12	OTHER NOTABLE MENTIONS ARE A CHRISTOPHER PLUMBER PLAY
5W7Z1C_fDaE_14	THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING ON IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT
pLTX3ipuDJI_10	BUT JUST A LITTLE WEEK OVER ALL FOR ME THEN WE WERE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO HIM AND IT WAS GONE QUICKLY
Bfr499ggo-0_19	BUT DON'T EXPECT MUCH
7JsX8y1ysxY_15	JUNIOR LADYCOTT WELL I DON'T SHE LOOKED AT FLINT FANTASTICALLY
Af8D0E4ZXaw_28	I CAN'T REALLY BLAME THEM FOR THAT
2iD-tVS8NPw_2	AT THE SAME TIME I DO WANTED TO SAY THAT I ENJOYED THIS RUBY
nzpVDcQ0ywM_21	AND IT'S SO SO SHORT LIVED HE BARELY NEEDS TO EVEN BE THERE
k5Y_838nuGo_21	I DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH I DON'T HEAR HER IN IT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_19	SHE IS ALSO A TERRIFIC ACTRESS
tmZoasNr4rU_13	AY AY I GUESS SO I MEAN IT IT'S IT WASN'T ANNOYING
0h-zjBukYpk_2	NOW I'M NOT GOING TO SHIVER LIKE THIS THIS MOVE HE FRUSTRATED ME TO SUCH AN EXTREME EXTENT THAT I WAS LOUDLY EXCLAIMING WHY AT THE END OF THE FILM
VbQk4H8hgr0_32	IT WASN'T EVEN REMOTELY GOOD
8OtFthrtaJM_20	OVER ALL OVER ALL IT HAD FAR TOO MANY PLOT HOLES AND
iiK8YX8oH1E_17	BUT HE HAS SOME OF THE FUNNIER SAINTS IN THIS MOOD
9J25DZhivz8_4	A VOICE ACTING EXCELLENCE
OQvJTdtJ2H4_6	AND THE CRACK IN YOU NOW AND THE YUE IT'S LIKE SO MUCH TYPE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_10	I'M AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF HAS HAD ITS MOMENTS
HEsqda8_d0Q_6	BUT I THOUGHT AS YOU WERE TO THE WELL
zhpQhgha_KU_25	I THINK THAT IS THAT IT'S A VERY RELATABLE ISSUE
yDtzw_Y-7RU_10	SOMETIMES I MISSED WHAT WAS BEING SAID
zhpQhgha_KU_6	AND IT HAD SOME VERY GOOD MOMENTS
cXypl4FnoZo_10	SO I AM I DON'T AGREE WITH THE SMITHY
GWuJjcEuzt8_5	SHE STILL LOOKS LIKE SHE IS FIFTY EIGHT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_6	NOT GOING TO
ZUXBRvtny7o_20	I'M TENDING HE'S OPENED FOR A SEQUEL
wMbj6ajWbic_5	ASKED THE COBBLER AH THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLY CHESSY BUT
jUzDDGyPkXU_5	IT DIDN'T TURN OUT QUITE NEARLY AS AWESOME AS THAT MOVIE DID
rnaNMUZpvvg_1	THE VERDICT IS STUPID AND A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY
cXypl4FnoZo_3	I'M I LIKED IT
WKA5OygbEKI_9	WELL TO JANNI THAT MAY BE SO WAS ENTERTAINING BUT
VbQk4H8hgr0_41	JUST A KIND OF MADE ME WANT TO REALLY WALK OUT OF THE THEATER
X3j2zQgwYgE_8	AND I GUESS NOT ONLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS ALL
2WGyTLYerpo_31	THINK HE DOES A GREAT JOB WITH WHAT HE DOES HE IS
9c67fiY0wGQ_1	AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WOULD APPEAL MORE TO A YOUNGER AUDIENCE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_28	I'M IN GENERAL I'M THE LITTLE KIDS SEEM TILL I GET I'M IN THERE BUT
VbQk4H8hgr0_49	I'M GOING TO WRITE THIS ONE TWO STARS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_3	IT WASN'T A BAD YEAR BUT
HEsqda8_d0Q_27	BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO SAY SO
aiEXnCPZubE_5	THE APERTURE FOUND THE UNINVITED IN
wMbj6ajWbic_3	OR BE COLLECTOR OF THE ABSENT FIGURES
_dI--eQ6qVU_20	JUST DIFFERENT
I5y0__X72p0_30	SO THERE WAS AN INTERESTING MOVE
f_pcplsH_V0_1	YOU'D BETTER APPRECIATE THIS
VbQk4H8hgr0_18	AND THERE WAS NOTHING HE'D OFFERED TO PLAY
9qR7uwkblbs_15	YOU KNOW APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO PEOPLE ON THE INNER AND A CAREY TUMBLER BECAUSE EVERY ONE TUMBLERS DON'T CRACK THEY DON'T THINK I LOOK LIKE HER OR LIKE SOUND LIKE HER OR ACT LIKE HER
c7UH_rxdZv4_31	HAVING THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT SHOWS GENUINE CARE FOR OTHER PEOPLE BE THE VILLAIN UM
TvyZBvOMOTc_4	IN THE SCENE OF THE DESTROYED CASTLE IT REALLY REMINDED ME WHY I WANT TO GO SO BADLY
8OtFthrtaJM_8	THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS CONSTANTLY COMPARING IT TO INCEPTION
iiK8YX8oH1E_6	THERE'S SOME FUNNY MOMENTS BUT
9qR7uwkblbs_27	COMEDY ROMANTIC BROMPTON
VbQk4H8hgr0_51	OF A TOMB TO BE FAIR BECAUSE
