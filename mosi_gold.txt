03bSnISJMiM_11	A LOT OF SAD PARTS
03bSnISJMiM_10	THERE IS SAD PART
03bSnISJMiM_13	AND ITS A REALLY FUNNY
03bSnISJMiM_12	BUT IT WAS REALLY REALLY AWESOME
03bSnISJMiM_1	ANYHOW IT WAS REALLY GOOD
03bSnISJMiM_3	I MEAN THEY DID A LITTLE BIT OF IT
03bSnISJMiM_2	THAY DID THEY DIDNT REALLY DO A WHOLE BUNCH OF BACKGROUND INFO ON WHY SHE HAS TO FIGHT AND BE PREPARED
03bSnISJMiM_5	AND THEY SHOULDVE I GUESS
03bSnISJMiM_4	BUT NOT A WHOLE BUNCH
03bSnISJMiM_7	AND XXX BUT BESIDES THAT IT WAS ALL OVER PRETTY GOOD
03bSnISJMiM_6	THEY SHOULDVE LIVE UP WITH MORE
03bSnISJMiM_9	OH MY GOD A LOT OF ACTION
03bSnISJMiM_8	AND THERE IS LIKE SOMEONE WHILE SOMEONE THERE WAS A LOT OF ACTION
0h-zjBukYpk_24	I MEAN THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE
0h-zjBukYpk_25	I LIKED THAT SCENE WHERE HE HAD A SWORDS IN THERE AND THERES BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA SHOOT HIM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM TAKE HIM DOWN TAKE HIM DOWN BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM TAKE THAT WITH MY MAGICAL SWORDS
0h-zjBukYpk_20	OK BUT THE TWO BIG CHARACTER APPEARANCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE EASILY DEADPOOL AND GAMBIT
0h-zjBukYpk_21	ACTUALLY I LIKED HIM A LOT
0h-zjBukYpk_22	AND I THOUGHT HE MADE A GOOD ACTOR FOR THE DEAD POOR CHARACTER
0h-zjBukYpk_23	NOW HES SEEN AT THE BEGINNING THAT REALLY SOLD ME
0h-zjBukYpk_1	NOW THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE BASICALLY SAYS IT ALL
0h-zjBukYpk_3	MY REASON IM A COMIC BOOK FAN
0h-zjBukYpk_2	NOW IM NOT EVEN GONNA SUGAR COAT THIS THIS MOVIE FRUSTRATED ME TO SUCH AN EXTREME EXTENT THAT I WAS LOUDLY EXCLAIMING WHY AT THE END OF THE FILM
0h-zjBukYpk_5	THAT HUH BEFORE WE GO ON WITH THAT I MUST SAY THAT THIS HAD A SURPRISINGLY DECENT CAST
0h-zjBukYpk_4	THAT LIKE TO SEE COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS TREATED RESPONSIBLY
0h-zjBukYpk_7	NOW HUGH JACKMAN WAS ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE TO PLAY WOLVERINE I WILL ADMIT THAT
0h-zjBukYpk_6	STRANGE SINCE ONE OF MY BIGGEST GRAPES WITH THE XMAN SERIES WAS AND ALWAYS IS THE XXX
0h-zjBukYpk_9	YOU KNOW NOTHING GREAT
0h-zjBukYpk_8	AND IN MY OPINION HE CARRIED THE MOVIE FINE
0h-zjBukYpk_11	HES A STAR OF THE MOVIE
0h-zjBukYpk_10	BUT YOU KNOW HE DID IT
0h-zjBukYpk_13	HE CARRIED IT
0h-zjBukYpk_12	NOTHING SPECIAL
0h-zjBukYpk_15	BUT ITS PRETTY SELFEXPLANATORY
0h-zjBukYpk_14	WHICH IS A SMART MOVE SINCE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE REAL COMIC BOOK FAN TO GET WHAT HES NAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE
0h-zjBukYpk_17	AND HE ALMOST LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THIS CHARACTER IN DEFIANCE
0h-zjBukYpk_16	UM I ACTUALLY THINK THAT LIEV SCHREIBER IS A GOOD ACTOR
0h-zjBukYpk_19	NOW OTHER PERFORMANCES ARE BORDERLINE
0h-zjBukYpk_18	I MEAN IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO TAKE OFF THE COSTUME OR SOMETHING
1DmNV9C1hbY_11	BUT FOR ME I WAS JUST A LITTLE BORED
1DmNV9C1hbY_10	KIDS ARE GONNA LOVE THE FILM
1DmNV9C1hbY_13	BUT OTHERWISE I DONT KNOW
1DmNV9C1hbY_12	SURE THERE WERE CUTE MONEY PARTS IN THE MIXTING OF THE FILM
1DmNV9C1hbY_14	I DIDNT EVEN CARE FOR IT
1DmNV9C1hbY_1	BUT FOR THIS ONE I JUST DIDNT FEEL LIKE IT
1DmNV9C1hbY_3	BECAUSE IT HAD A REAL NOSTALGIC FEEL TO IT
1DmNV9C1hbY_2	UM I LOVED THE VERY FIRST ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS MOVIE
1DmNV9C1hbY_5	BUT YOU KNOW FOR THIS ONE I JUST DIDNT CARE
1DmNV9C1hbY_4	IT REMINDED ME OF GETTING UP ON A SATURDAY MORNING AND EATING FRUIT LOOPS AND UM WATCHING CARTOONS
1DmNV9C1hbY_7	AND UM WHILE THE TRAILER MADE THE FILM LOOK REAL NICE AND CUTE
1DmNV9C1hbY_6	UM I SAW NO REASON WHY THEY NEEDED TO BRING BACK THE VILLAIN FROM THE FIRST ONE
1DmNV9C1hbY_9	UM IM SURE KIDS ARE GONNA LOVE IT
1DmNV9C1hbY_8	IT WAS JUST FLAT
1iG0909rllw_24	AND YOU KNEW YOU SHOULDNT BE LAUGHING
1iG0909rllw_25	MY FAVORITE SCENE WOULD DEFINATELY BE THE VOLTURI
1iG0909rllw_26	UM THEN MY WINS ON SCREEN WISKERS I MEAN THEY WERE REALLY WORN IN A LOTS WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I THOUGHT XXX REALLY RATHER GOOD
1iG0909rllw_27	AND UM MICHAEL SHEEN AS ARO AS WELL HE WAS RATHER ENJOYABLE TO WATCH
1iG0909rllw_20	AND THE SCRIPT IT LEFT ALL THE KEY PLOTS AND EMOTION FROM THE CHARACTERS TO BE EXPOSED THROUGH DIALOGUE
1iG0909rllw_21	I THINK IT WAS EMPIRE MAGAZINES REVIEW OF NEW MOON THAT SAID THAT KRISTEN RELIED HEAVILY ON THE TACTIC OF TACTIC OF BLINKING A LOT WHICH SHE REALLY DOES DO A LOT
1iG0909rllw_22	BUT AT THE SAME GOES FOR ROB PATTINSON AS EDWARD AND TAYLOR LAUTNER AS JACOB THEY DO A LOT OF FROWNING IM A MANLY MAN AND I FROWN
1iG0909rllw_23	FOR THE MOMENT IN THIS THE WHOLE CINEMA WAS LAUGHTING
1iG0909rllw_28	AND I THINK THE VOLTURI THAT WAS MY EXCITING BIT OF THE ENTIRE FILM
1iG0909rllw_29	THE REST OF THE FILM WAS JUST WATCHING KRISTEN JUST MOB AROUND
1iG0909rllw_1	AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE AVERAGE
1iG0909rllw_3	I THOUGHT TWILIGHT DIRECTED BY CATHERINE HARDWICKE WAS ACTUALLY REALLY RATHER ENJOYABLE
1iG0909rllw_2	LETS FACE IT THEY ARE REALLY NOT MASTER PIECES
1iG0909rllw_5	BUT CINEMATICLY I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD QUITE GOOD
1iG0909rllw_4	UM I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT HAD ITS FLAWS
1iG0909rllw_7	I WASNT THINKING ON HEARING THAT CHRIS WEITZ WAS GONNA START THE NEW MOON BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT WAS PHILLIP PULLMAN THE GOLDEN COMPASS
1iG0909rllw_6	IT WASIT WAS ENJOYABLE
1iG0909rllw_9	AND I I DIDINT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM NEW MOON UM IN TERMS OF HIS DIRECTION
1iG0909rllw_8	I THOUGHT THAT FILM WAS AWFUL
1iG0909rllw_11	THE THING IS ITS A VERY GOOD TRANSLATION OF THE BOOK
1iG0909rllw_10	OVERALL NEW MOON WAS IT WAS OK JUST AVERAGE
1iG0909rllw_13	AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT LOYALTY
1iG0909rllw_12	ITS VERY VERY LOYAL TO THE BOOK
1iG0909rllw_15	AND THE BOOK IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST THRILLING BOOK EVER
1iG0909rllw_14	UM HOWEVER IT IS THIS LOYALTY TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE THAT GIVES IT ITS FLAWS
1iG0909rllw_17	IT WASNT REALLY THE BEST THE MOST THRILLING READ EVER ILL SAY THAT
1iG0909rllw_16	I MEAN THE ENTIRE XXX IS BELLA SWAN KRISTEN KRISTENS STEWARDS CHARACTER MOBBING AROUND COMPLETELY DEPRESSED
1iG0909rllw_19	THE ANGSTY TOO ANGSTY MOMENTS WITHDRAWN OUT TO THE MAX AS FAR AS THAY CAN GO
1iG0909rllw_18	SO OVERALLNEW MOON EVEN WITH THE BIGGER BETTER BUDGETS HUH IT WAS STILL TOO LONG
1iG0909rllw_30	AND THAT WAS REALLY BORING
2WGyTLYerpo_56	LIKE A MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD THINK WOULD BE KIND OF LIKE CRAZY
2WGyTLYerpo_54	I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF STUPID
2WGyTLYerpo_42	SO YOU CAN CARE ABOUT HIM
2WGyTLYerpo_48	THERE ARE SOME FLAWS HERE
2WGyTLYerpo_43	AND ALSOUM OLIVIA WILD SHES PRETTY GOOD
2WGyTLYerpo_60	AND IM GONNA GIVE IT AN EIGHT OUT OF TEN
2WGyTLYerpo_61	IT WAS REALLY FUN
2WGyTLYerpo_62	A VERY GOOD TIME
2WGyTLYerpo_63	AND I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND YOU CHECK IT OUT IN THEATERS
2WGyTLYerpo_49	AND THERE BUT THEYRE NOT HUGE GLARING FLAWS
2WGyTLYerpo_52	BUT I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING THAT
2WGyTLYerpo_53	I WASNT A HUGE FAN OF IT
2WGyTLYerpo_24	AND ALSO I LIKE HOW ITS KIND OF UPFRONT TO SHOW THEM TO US INSTEAD OF HIDING THEM LIKE SHOWING A LITTLE LIKE AN ARM ON SCENE OR SOMETHING NO THEY JUST STRAIGHT UP SHOW IT TO US
2WGyTLYerpo_25	AND I REALLY ENJOYED THAT
2WGyTLYerpo_26	I IT WAS REALLY COOL WHEN THEY DID THAT
2WGyTLYerpo_27	COZ THE ALIENS WERE REALLY COOL LOOKING
2WGyTLYerpo_20	THEY ARE HUGE
2WGyTLYerpo_21	THEYRE REALLY STRONG
2WGyTLYerpo_22	AND THEYRE KIND OF SCARY LOOKING
2WGyTLYerpo_23	I DIDNT EXPECT THAT
2WGyTLYerpo_46	SHES ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
2WGyTLYerpo_47	SHES IN EVERYTHING NOWADAYS
2WGyTLYerpo_45	AND SHES NOT A BAD ACTOR
2WGyTLYerpo_28	DANIEL CRAIG DOES A VERY GOOD JOB HERE
2WGyTLYerpo_29	HE KIND OF CHANNELS THE MAN WITH NO NAME CLINT EASTWOOD
2WGyTLYerpo_40	BUT HE BECOMES MORE LIKEABLE
2WGyTLYerpo_41	HIS GUTS DEVELOPED MORE AS MORE LIKEABLE CHARACTER
2WGyTLYerpo_1	MUCH SAY THAT I REALLY ENJOYED COWBOYS AND ALIENS
2WGyTLYerpo_3	YOU GUYS DONT KNOW WHAT YOURE GONNA GO AND SEE WHEN YOU GO WALK INTO THE MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS
2WGyTLYerpo_2	THERE WAS A LOT OF FUN
2WGyTLYerpo_5	THE ONLY OSCAR THAT I CAN EVEN THING OF IS MAYBE LIKE BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY
2WGyTLYerpo_4	IF YOURE EXPECTING SOME ARTSY SERIOUS OSCAR CONTENDER THAN YOURE WRONG
2WGyTLYerpo_7	AND MAYBE BEST VISUAL EFFECTS
2WGyTLYerpo_6	BECAUSE THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IN THIS MOVIE IS GREAT
2WGyTLYerpo_9	BUT AGAIN YOU YOU CANT EXPECT A HUGE LIKE SURREAL MIND BENDER FROM THE MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS YO
2WGyTLYerpo_8	COZ THE VISUAL EFFECTS ARE PRETTY COOL
2WGyTLYerpo_51	SUCH AS SOMETIMES THE ALIENS IN THE WESTERN SETTING DO LOOK A LITTLE GOOFY
2WGyTLYerpo_39	AT FIRST HES JUST KIND OF LIKE GRUMPY OLD GUY
2WGyTLYerpo_38	HES HE GIVES AN ENTERTAINING PERFORMANCE AS THE KIND OF LIKE THE LEADER THE OF THE TOWN
2WGyTLYerpo_59	OVERALL I REALLY ENJOYED COWBOYS AND ALIENS
2WGyTLYerpo_58	NOT A HUGE FLAW BUT ITS THERE AND ITS NOTICABLE
2WGyTLYerpo_11	THE ACTION IS REALLY INTENSE WHICH SURPRISED ME
2WGyTLYerpo_10	AND ITS SATISFACTORY
2WGyTLYerpo_13	THERES SOME REALLY INTENSE ACTION SCENES ESPECIALLY THE SCENE WHEN THE ALIENS FIRST INVADE
2WGyTLYerpo_12	I DIDNT EXPECT THE ACTION TO BE SO INTENSE
2WGyTLYerpo_15	IT GAVE ME CHILLS
2WGyTLYerpo_14	THAT SCENE IS LIKE CRAZY
2WGyTLYerpo_17	THE ACTION IS REALLY COOL
2WGyTLYerpo_16	I ITS A LOT OF FUN
2WGyTLYerpo_19	ONE THING I LIKE WITH THE ALIENS IS THAT A THEY ARE NOT JUST WEAK LINKS THAT HIDE BEHIND THE TECHNOLOGY
2WGyTLYerpo_18	THE ALIENS ARE REALLY COOL
2WGyTLYerpo_31	I THINK HE DOES A GREAT JOB AT WHAT HE DOES
2WGyTLYerpo_30	AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT
2WGyTLYerpo_37	HARRISON FORD IS ALSO GOOD
2WGyTLYerpo_36	ALSO HIS INNOCENT ACCENT IS PRETTY CONVINCING
2WGyTLYerpo_35	AND HE DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB
2WGyTLYerpo_34	HE DOESNT TAKE CRAP FROM ANYBODY
2WGyTLYerpo_33	IS REALLY REALLY HARD CORE
2WGyTLYerpo_55	AND SOMETIMES IT KIND OF VEERS INTO CLICHE ACTION MOVIE TERRITORY
2WGyTLYerpo_32	HES A REALLY BAD ASS
2WGyTLYerpo_57	BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST VEERS ENTIRELY CLICHE ACTION MOVIE TERRITORY AGAIN
2WGyTLYerpo_50	BUT THEY ARE NOTICABLE FLAWS
2iD-tVS8NPw_24	BUT THEN YOU KIND OF LIKE WALK OUT OF THE MOVIE AND YOURE LIKE WELL I I GET WHAT HAPPENED I UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED
2iD-tVS8NPw_25	BUT WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR GREEN LANTERN MOVIE 2 THAT WOULD BE EVEN LIKE WORTH WHILE NOW
2iD-tVS8NPw_26	BECAUSE I MEAN IF HES ABLE TO DO ALL OF THIS SORT OF STUFF LIKE HOW YOURE SUPPOSED TO REALLY PUT UP A FORCE THAT CAN PUSH HIM TO THE NEXT LEVEL OR OR DESTROY HIM AT THE SAME TIME
2iD-tVS8NPw_27	AND IT DOES KIND OF A LEA HELPS ALLEVIATE WHAT THAT WHOLE WAS IS ABOUT FIGHTING THE ULTIMATE ENEMY WITHIN THIS FIRST MOVIE AND THAT THE THREAT IS STILL THERE POTENTIALLY SPEAKING
2iD-tVS8NPw_20	BUT I THINK THERE WAS ALSO SOME SORT OF LIKE UM TONE WITHIN THE ACTUAL UM POWERS OF THE GREEN LANTERN AND HIMSELF AND THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY THINK UP OF ANYTHING AND YOU CAN PROJECT THAT INTO THE REAL LIFE
2iD-tVS8NPw_21	AND I THINK HAVING THIS SORT OF SUPERPOWER ALMOST THIS POWER TO JUST IMAGINE ANYTHING KIND OF JUST UM HELPED ME GET PASSED THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL CGI CHARACTERS AND SET
2iD-tVS8NPw_22	THIS IS A PLAYGROUND AND THEIR IMAGINARY PLAYGROUND AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ANYTHING THAT WHAT ALSO MADE THE FILM EXCITING
2iD-tVS8NPw_23	BECAUSE YOU DONT ENTIRELY KNOW WHATS COMING NEXT
2iD-tVS8NPw_28	SO ITS KIND OF INTERESTING TO SEE UM WHERE THEYRE GONNA BE GOING WITH THAT
2iD-tVS8NPw_29	IM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT IVE GOT TO SAY
2iD-tVS8NPw_1	BEFORE I WENT IN TO SEE THE GREEN LANTERN IVE BEEN HEARING ALL THESE LIKE CRITICS BASICALLY JUST TRASHING THIS MOVIE LEFT AND RIGHT
2iD-tVS8NPw_3	I ENJOYED IT FOR WHAT IT WAS YOU KNOW
2iD-tVS8NPw_2	BUT I AT THE SAME TIME I DO WANNA JUST SAY THAT I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE
2iD-tVS8NPw_5	THIS IS A MOVIE THAT YOURE GONNA GO OUT AND SEE
2iD-tVS8NPw_4	ITS A HUGE SORT OF SPECTACLE MOVIE THAT IS GREAT FOR THIS SUMMER TIME YOU KNOW
2iD-tVS8NPw_7	BECAUSE I I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THIS PROBABLY IS ONE OF THE FIRST MOVIES THIS YEAR THAT IVE SEEN THIS YEAR THAT YOU WANNA SEE IN 3D ESPECIALLY FOR JUST THE OPENING PORTION
2iD-tVS8NPw_6	AND YOU WANNA SEE IT IN 3D
2iD-tVS8NPw_9	AND THE REST OF IT DOES LOOK GOOD AS WELL
2iD-tVS8NPw_8	IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD
2iD-tVS8NPw_11	ITS NOT LIKE A DARK MOVIE OR ANYTHING
2iD-tVS8NPw_10	AND I JUST HAD FUN WATCHING THIS MOVIE
2iD-tVS8NPw_13	SO ITS PERFECT FOR KIDS AS WELL AS JUST LIKE TEENAGERS AS WELL WHO JUST WANNA SEE A LOT OF EXPLOSIONS AND SOME CRAZY STUFF
2iD-tVS8NPw_12	ITS VERY MUCH A LIGHT HEARTED
2iD-tVS8NPw_15	BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A CARTOON
2iD-tVS8NPw_14	AND YOU KNOW GOING INTO IT OR THESE WATCHING THE TRAILERS BEFORE HEAD I WAS REALLY KIND OF HESITANT ABOUT SEEING THE GREEN LANTERN IN THE FIRST PLACE
2iD-tVS8NPw_17	BECAUSE I THINK WHY NOT JUST MAKE THIS YOU KNOW MOVIE THIS LIVE ACTION MOVIE AND TALK CARTOON
2iD-tVS8NPw_16	IM NOT REALLY A HUGE FAN OF HAVING LIKE ALL THESE 3D CHARACTERS
2iD-tVS8NPw_19	AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE GONNA GO THAT ROUTE
2iD-tVS8NPw_18	THATS REALLY THE ROUTE THAT YOURE GONNA GO
2iD-tVS8NPw_30	ITS NOT LIKE THE GREEN LANTERN IS THE NEXT BATMAN BEGINS OR OR THE DARK NIGHTER
5W7Z1C_fDaE_24	YEAP ABSOLUTELY NOT TO BE MISSED

5W7Z1C_fDaE_3	ITS BOLD
5W7Z1C_fDaE_2	UM AS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS FILM IS ITS BIG
5W7Z1C_fDaE_5	IT MAKES BIG POWERFULS STATEMENTS
5W7Z1C_fDaE_4	ITS STRONG
5W7Z1C_fDaE_7	EVERYTHING FROM THE WAY ITS BEING RELEASED TO THE PERFORMANCES AND TO THE STORY ITSELF IS ABSOLUTELY OVRT THE TOP IMPRESSIVE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_6	IT DOESNT HOLD BACK
5W7Z1C_fDaE_9	ITS A HUGE BREAK THROUGH FOR KEVIN SMITH
5W7Z1C_fDaE_8	AND REALLY WELL DONE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_11	JOHN GOODMAN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
5W7Z1C_fDaE_10	ITS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING WEVE EVER SEEN HIM DO BEFORE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_13	ITS SO WELL DONE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_12	MELISSA LEO WILL HAVE YOU CREEPED OUT TO YOUR INNER CORE WITH HER TINY LITTLE SMILE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_15	ITS A HORROR FILM IA A TRUE SENSE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_14	FOR ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HATING ON IT I DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT
5W7Z1C_fDaE_17	UM IT IS IT IS DEFINATELY ONE OF THOSE FILMS THATS NOT GONNA BE EASY FOR YOU TO FIND
5W7Z1C_fDaE_16	AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING
5W7Z1C_fDaE_19	WHENEVER IT COMES TO YOUR TOWN DO NOT MISS IT
5W7Z1C_fDaE_18	ITS BEING RELEASED IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY
6Egk_28TtTM_11	AND I THINK I WHY I WOULD BE SCARED IS BECAUSE I WOULD FEEL SCARED AND KIND OF SAD IF I LOST MY OWN MOTHER
6Egk_28TtTM_10	I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY S KIND OF SCARY
6Egk_28TtTM_12	BUT IT ALL TURNS OUT GREAT IN THE END
6Egk_28TtTM_1	I JUST GOT FINISHED WATCHING AN EXCELLENT MOVIE CALLED MARS NEEDS MOMS
6Egk_28TtTM_3	I LIKED GRIBBLE BECAUSE HE HELPED MILO GET MILOS MOTHER AWAY FROM THE ALIANS
6Egk_28TtTM_2	AND MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE TO BE MILO MILOS MOTHER AND GRIBBLE
6Egk_28TtTM_5	AND MY FAVORITE PART IN THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MILO HAS TO SAVE GRIBBLE
6Egk_28TtTM_4	WHICH I THOUGHT WAS AWESOME
6Egk_28TtTM_7	BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD MOVIE
6Egk_28TtTM_6	AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR AGES 3 AND UP
6Egk_28TtTM_9	LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MY BROTHER IS FIVE YEARS OLD AND HE DIDNT THINK THIS MOVIE WAS SCARY AT ALL
6Egk_28TtTM_8	AND IT DEPENDS WHAT AGE YOU ARE AND HOW YOU TO HOW YOU FEEL LIKE SEE THE MOVIE
6_0THN4chvY_11	BEACUSE I WANTED TO SEE HOW THEY COULD FRAME THAT
6_0THN4chvY_10	UM THAT WAS PROBABLY PART OF THE TRAILER THAT GOT ME TO GO AND SEE THE MOVIE
6_0THN4chvY_13	ITS A GREAT ONE
6_0THN4chvY_12	SO UM IF YOU HAVENT SEEN WINNIE THE POOH AND YOU LIKE FAMILY FILMS GO SEE IT
6_0THN4chvY_14	I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND IT
6_0THN4chvY_1	AND SO I WAS KIND OF CURIOUS TO SEE MAYBE IF THAT WAS WHAT DISNEY WAS GOING FOR AND IT DEFINATELY WAS WHAT THAY WERE GOING FOR
6_0THN4chvY_3	UM ITS ITS GREAT IF YOU REMEMBER THAT WAS OLD FILMS
6_0THN4chvY_2	BUT I BET IF YOU PUT THEM NEXT TO THE NEW FILM THAT THE STYLE WOULD BE SIMILAR ENOUGH THAT YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO REALLY TELL WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS
6_0THN4chvY_5	THE STORY IS PRETTY SIMPLE
6_0THN4chvY_4	WOULD BE GREAT FOR KIDS TOO
6_0THN4chvY_7	UM FUNNY JOKES THAT THE KIDS WOULD GET
6_0THN4chvY_6	WEVE GOT GREAT JOKES
6_0THN4chvY_9	BECAUSE HE SAYS ISSUE AND THEY THINK HE IS SAYING AT YOU
6_0THN4chvY_8	UM I LOVE THE SCENE WHERE EEYORE AND POOH THINK THAT OWL IS GETTING SICK
73jzhE8R1TQ_11	AND BUT XXX WERE TOO HOLLYWOOD FOR ME
73jzhE8R1TQ_10	THE NUMBERS THEY AND THEY KIND OF STUCK TO THE BOOK OF IT SO I LIKE THAT
73jzhE8R1TQ_13	BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU IF YOUR TOP PRIORITY IS SURVIVAL THAN WHY WOULD YOU BE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
73jzhE8R1TQ_12	LIKE TH THIS THING ISNT REALLY A BIG DEAL BUT UM I I DDINT LIKE THE FACT THAT JOHN HAD AN IPHONE
73jzhE8R1TQ_15	BUT MY OPININ LIKE HE SHOULDNT HAVE AN IPHONE HE SHOULDNT CARE ABOUT THE LATEST TRENDS SO THATS REALLY WHAT THE LIEUTENANT XXX
73jzhE8R1TQ_14	SO SINCE WERE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION IS THEY COULD BE LIKE SCRAPING BY OR THEY COULD BE TOTALLY RICH
73jzhE8R1TQ_17	UM LIKE I SAID IT WASNT BIG DEAL
73jzhE8R1TQ_16	I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL TOO COMMERCIAL IN THAT ASPECT
73jzhE8R1TQ_19	UM ANOTHER THING THAT DID BOTHER ME WERE THE KISSINGS
73jzhE8R1TQ_18	AND YOU PROBABLY DONT THINK SO BUT YOU KNOW JUST ONE OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT THAT HURT YOU FOR SOME REASON YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
73jzhE8R1TQ_1	UM SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT I LIKED ABOUT THE MOVIE BETTER THAN I LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK AND VICE VERSE
73jzhE8R1TQ_3	MAYBE BECAUSE NUMBER FOUR WAS NOT MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK
73jzhE8R1TQ_2	IT WASNT LIKE IT WASNT LIKE OH THE BOOK WAS SO MUCH HARDER THAN MOVIE
73jzhE8R1TQ_5	BUT BUT UM I WASNT CRAZY ABOUT IT
73jzhE8R1TQ_4	IT WAS A GOOD BOOK
73jzhE8R1TQ_7	SO I LIKED THE MOVIE
73jzhE8R1TQ_6	SO YEAH AND THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY GOOD IN MY OPINION
73jzhE8R1TQ_9	GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THING WITH LORAIN THE MOGADORIANS
73jzhE8R1TQ_8	BECAUSE IT DID A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THE BACK STORY IN THE BOOK
7JsX8y1ysxY_24	UM HE WAS AWESOME
7JsX8y1ysxY_25	LIKE HE WAS INCREDIBLE
7JsX8y1ysxY_26	THE OTHER GUY THAT DID A REALLY GOOD JOB WAS UM JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN
7JsX8y1ysxY_27	HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB
7JsX8y1ysxY_20	ILL TELL YOU WHO MADE THE MOVIE
7JsX8y1ysxY_21	WHO WAS JUST KICK ASS 100 OF TIME WAS THE GUY THAT PLAYED OUR RORSCHACH
7JsX8y1ysxY_22	BUT ANYWAYS HE WAS AWESOME
7JsX8y1ysxY_23	I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY COOL
7JsX8y1ysxY_28	VERY DARK
7JsX8y1ysxY_29	UM I REALLY LIKED SICKO GUY
7JsX8y1ysxY_1	UM GRAPHICS WERE INCREDIBLE
7JsX8y1ysxY_3	SOME REALLY SUCKY ACTING
7JsX8y1ysxY_2	UM SOME REALLY GOOD ACTING
7JsX8y1ysxY_5	COZ PEOPLE WERE LIKE EATING POPCORN AND YOU SEE THE FIRST SHOW AND PEOPLE YOU HEAR LIKE THIS THIS RIPPLE EFFECT OF WHISPERING OH MY GOD IS THAT A IS THAT AM I LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT WHAT
7JsX8y1ysxY_4	SO THIS WAS PRETTY FUNNY
7JsX8y1ysxY_7	UM THERE COULDVE BEEN LESS BLUE NUDITY
7JsX8y1ysxY_6	I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY
7JsX8y1ysxY_9	IT WAS FUNNY THOUGH
7JsX8y1ysxY_8	BECAUSE WHAT WAS WEIRD WAS THE FACT THAT IN PART OF THE MOVIE HES WEARING LIKE A BLUE UM OVERALL FLONG THING MEDAL FLONG THING SO I WAS LIKE WHY NOT WEAR THE WHOLE WHOLE TIME YOU KNOW WHY WHY YOU GOT TO GO COMMAND ON US
7JsX8y1ysxY_39	BUT UM YOU KNOW OVERALL IT WAS GOOD
7JsX8y1ysxY_38	UM SO AT THE END THERES NOT REALLY A WHOLE LOT OF REDEEMING VALUE THAT I THINK YOU COME UP WITH
7JsX8y1ysxY_11	ITS KIND OF WEIRD
7JsX8y1ysxY_10	HES FUNNY
7JsX8y1ysxY_13	ALL RIGHT SO ENOUGH OF THE NUDITY
7JsX8y1ysxY_12	I DONT KNOW CLASSIC SUPERHERO KIND OF GETTING ON KIND OF THING
7JsX8y1ysxY_15	UM JUNIOR LADY GIRL I KNOW I I MEAN SHE LOOKED FAN FANTASTIC
7JsX8y1ysxY_14	UM BUT WHAT SUCKED WHAT WAS BAD WAS MALIN AKERMAN THE GIRL WHO PLAYS THE SILK SPECTRE II
7JsX8y1ysxY_17	SHE LOOKED LIKE A SUPERHERO
7JsX8y1ysxY_16	SHE LOOKED PHENOMENAL
7JsX8y1ysxY_19	AND THERES A VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS
7JsX8y1ysxY_18	BUT SHE ACTED LIKE POWER RANGER
7JsX8y1ysxY_31	I WAS VERY IMPRESSED
7JsX8y1ysxY_30	BUT UM HE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB AT ACTING
7JsX8y1ysxY_37	AND IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS SORT OF OVERWHELMINGLY BAD
7JsX8y1ysxY_36	AND UM THERES NOT IN MY OPINION THERE WASNT VERY MUCH OF A BALANCE BETWEEN SORT OF LIKE THE GOOD EVIL KIND OF THING
7JsX8y1ysxY_35	I WARN YOU ITS A VERY VERY DARK
7JsX8y1ysxY_34	UM BUT ITS EXTREMELY DARK
7JsX8y1ysxY_33	AND ITS VERY VERY INTERESTING
7JsX8y1ysxY_32	SO OVERALL ITS ITS LIKE A BLEND OF YOUVE GOT ALTERNATIVE HISTORY
8OtFthrtaJM_20	OVERALL OVERALL IT HAD FAR TOO MANY PLOT HOLES
8OtFthrtaJM_21	AND JUST NOT ENOUGH DEPTH TO BE INTERESTING
8OtFthrtaJM_22	I HAVE TO SAY MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS THE CHARACTER THOMPSON
8OtFthrtaJM_23	BUT HES JUST THE CREEPIEST OLD GUY YOULL EVER SEE IN YOUR LIFE HE STANDS OVER PEOPLE WHEN THEYRE ASLEEP JUST STARING AT THEM
8OtFthrtaJM_1	WHICH IS WHERE ALL GREAT RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD START
8OtFthrtaJM_3	I LITERALLY SAID OUT LOUD WHAT QUE WHAT IS THIS MOVIE THAT I AM SEEING WHAT IS THIS
8OtFthrtaJM_2	AND JUST ITS VERY ITS VERY CHAOTIC AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE
8OtFthrtaJM_5	BUT THERES A REASON FOR THAT THERES A REASON FOR WHY I WAS CONFUSED
8OtFthrtaJM_4	I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE
8OtFthrtaJM_7	THANKS A LOT COMMERCIAL
8OtFthrtaJM_6	FIRST OFF THE COMMERCIAL MAKES THE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MISTAKE OF SAYING THAT IT IS MORE THOUGHT PROVOKING THAN INCEPTION
8OtFthrtaJM_9	BUT I MUST SAY THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY BIG SHOES TO FILL SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IT HAS A CHANCE
8OtFthrtaJM_8	THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS CONSTANTLY COMPARING IT TO INCEPTION
8OtFthrtaJM_11	I WAS JUST WAITING FOR JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT TO COME OUT JUST JUMP OUT ANY TIME AND SAY ITS A PARADOX
8OtFthrtaJM_10	I I SHOULD GIVE IT A SHOT YOU KNOW
8OtFthrtaJM_13	WHICH KIND OF JUST RUINS THE SUSPENSE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE IF YOUVE GOT SOME CONVENIENT GUY IN A FEDORA TO JUST TELL YOU OH YES WE ARE THE ADJUSTEMENT BUREAU AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO YOU KNOW ITS JUST KIND OF RUINS THE SUSPENSE
8OtFthrtaJM_12	NOW THE ONLY SUSPENSFUL PART THAT I FOUND IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MATT DAMON FIRST DISCOVERS THE BUREAU IN THE FIRST PLACE
8OtFthrtaJM_15	INTERESTINGLY IT TURNED OUT TO BE MORE OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY THAN IT WAS A THRILLER
8OtFthrtaJM_14	AND NOW IM NOT IM NOT EXCITED ANYMORE
8OtFthrtaJM_17	YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS FUNNY AT TIMES
8OtFthrtaJM_16	UM YOU KNOW IT HAD SOME INTERESTING WRITING
8OtFthrtaJM_19	BUT JUST ASIDE FROM THAT THEY REALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THE SUSPENSFUL PARTS
8OtFthrtaJM_18	MATT DAMON IS A YOU KNOW HES A PRETTY FUNNY GUY
8d-gEyoeBzc_24	BUT HE ACTUALLY FOUND UM WHEN HES SEEN COME UP IT SLOWED THE MOVIE DOWN UM AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM UM WITH PREDATOR TO PREDATORS COMPARED TO PREDATOR
8d-gEyoeBzc_25	PREDATOR IS REALLY WELL PACED MOVIE
8d-gEyoeBzc_26	AND IT PICKS UP SPEED AND NEVER LETS GO EV EVEN IN THE SAME XXX WHERE THEY THEY SLOW YOU KNOW THEY MEANT TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE AND AND TALK ABOUT WHATS GOING ON YO YOU KNOW
8d-gEyoeBzc_27	IT FELT THE MOVIE SLOWED DOWN WHERES IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
8d-gEyoeBzc_20	UM HE HAD SOME FUNNY HE HAD A FEW ONE LINES THAT WAS QUITE QUITE FUNNY
8d-gEyoeBzc_21	YEAH ONCE UNFORTUNATELY UM I THINK IN THE WRITING SOMEWHERE THEY THEY JUST WERENT UM DEVELOPED ENOUGH FEAR TO CARE ABOUT THEM UM AND THAT INCLUDES IS IT TOPHER GRACES I THINK I THINK HIS NAME WAS INCLUDS HIS CHARACTER UM
8d-gEyoeBzc_22	UM I JUST DIDNT THINK IT WAS WELL DEVELOPED ENOUGH AND UM I ALSO I I INCLUDE IN THAT LAURENCE FISHBURNES CHARACTER AS WELL
8d-gEyoeBzc_23	WHO I THINK RODRIGEZ WHEN HE WROTE THE MO WROTE THE MOVIE WAS GOING FOR A MARLON BRANDO APOCALIPSE NOW TYPE OF CHARACTER
8d-gEyoeBzc_28	WHEN WHEN THEY THEY WITH UM LAURENCE FISHBURNE CHARACTER IT DOES SLOW DOWN A GREAT DEAL
8d-gEyoeBzc_29	I DIDNT REALLY FEEL UM THE INCLUSION OF HIS CHARATER WAS NECESSARY
8d-gEyoeBzc_1	UM IM GONNA GIVE THE REASONS WHY I LIKE HIM
8d-gEyoeBzc_3	UM WHICH I THINK RODRIGEZ WAS GOING FOR HE TH TH HE ALWAYS SAID THAT HE WAS GONNA DO THE SEQUEL UM HE WANTED THIS TO BE UM TH THE PREDATOR EQUIVALENT OF ALIENS
8d-gEyoeBzc_2	BUT MOSTLY IM GONNA GIVE THE REASONS OF WHY I DONT THINK HES GONNA BE A CLASSIC IN THE SAME WAY AS THE FIRST MOVIE PREDATOR OR ALIENS
8d-gEyoeBzc_5	UM AND IM GONNA REALLY POINT OUT WHY THAT I DONT THINK HE REALLY PULLED HE PULLED THAT OFF
8d-gEyoeBzc_4	UM AS UM YOU KNOW AS ALIENS WAS TO ALIEN
8d-gEyoeBzc_7	UM BUT I DID ENJOY IT
8d-gEyoeBzc_6	UM WHY WAS A MISTAKE REALLY TO TRY AND DO THAT
8d-gEyoeBzc_9	THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL DEVELOPED UM NOT ALL OF THE CHARACTERS
8d-gEyoeBzc_8	SO UM IM GONNA POINT OUT THE STUFF I DID LIKE THERE WERE SOME ACTION SCENES IN IT
8d-gEyoeBzc_11	UM I I LIKED AGENT BRODYS CHARACTER
8d-gEyoeBzc_10	BUT UM I WOULD SAY THAT UM THERE WAS THERES GOOD THERE WERE FOUR GOOD CHARACTERS IN THERE
8d-gEyoeBzc_13	YOU KNOW WELL DRAWN OUT CHARACTER
8d-gEyoeBzc_12	I THOUGHT HE WAS UM WELL DEVELOPED
8d-gEyoeBzc_15	I LIKED THE GIRL WHO WAS THE ISRAELI SNIPER
8d-gEyoeBzc_14	SOMEONE YOU CARED ABOUT
8d-gEyoeBzc_17	UM I LIKED THE RUSSIAN GUY JURI
8d-gEyoeBzc_16	I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE NUMBER ONE WELL DRAWN CHARACTER
8d-gEyoeBzc_19	AND XXX WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER
8d-gEyoeBzc_18	UM YOU CARED YOU THERE WAS ENOUGH IN THERE FOR YOU TO CARE ABOUT HIM
8d-gEyoeBzc_30	UM IT COULDVE BEEN WRITTEN OUT
8qrpnFRGt2A_24	I MEAN THIS MOVIE MAKES UM MAKES UM STAR WARS PRETTY CLOSE
8qrpnFRGt2A_25	I MEAN ITS ITS ABOUT THAT LEVEL STAR WAR IS
8qrpnFRGt2A_26	PRETTY CLOSE AS FAR AS JUST CGI HEAVY LIKE THIS TIME ITS WHAT ITS LIKE HUMAN FACE AND EVERYTHING AROUND THAT FACE IS CARTOON CGI COMPUTER EFFECTS
8qrpnFRGt2A_20	AND THATS BECAUSE ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE I REALIZED THAT THIS IS JUST ITS REALLY JUST A CARTOON
8qrpnFRGt2A_21	IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A LIVE ACTION MOVIE YOU YOURE GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED
8qrpnFRGt2A_22	BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A CARTOON WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH MOSTLY IS WITH ALL THE CGI FX
8qrpnFRGt2A_23	AND AND THERE IS A LOT OF IT
8qrpnFRGt2A_1	AND UM I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS WATCHING THIS I PURPOSLY PUT IT ON BECAUSE I FIGURED IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE STUPID THAT I COULD FALL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF AND NOT MISS TOO MUCH
8qrpnFRGt2A_3	SO I DIDNT DIDNT HAVE VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS MOVIE
8qrpnFRGt2A_2	JUST WANTED SOMETHING TO WATCH WHILE I WAS FALLING ASLEEP
8qrpnFRGt2A_5	BECAUSE I THREE MAJOR COMPLAINTS I HAVE ABOUT THIS MOVIE
8qrpnFRGt2A_4	AND I UM PRETTY MUCH IT PRETTY MUCH MET MY LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MOST PART
8qrpnFRGt2A_7	AND UM THE STORY WAS PRETTY WEIRD
8qrpnFRGt2A_6	UM BIGGEST ONE IS THE CGI EFFECTS WERE JUST TERRIBLE
8qrpnFRGt2A_9	AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN IT MIGHT HAVE MADE MORE SENSE
8qrpnFRGt2A_8	UM AND AGAIN I I IF I HAD TO PAY CLOSER ATTENTION I MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED IT MORE
8qrpnFRGt2A_11	WHICH I MEAN FOR A MOVIE ABOUT JI JOE NINTY MINUTES IS ENOUGH
8qrpnFRGt2A_10	UM UM THIS MOVIE THIS MOVIE UM BY HALF WAY THROUGH I WAS CHECKING THE TIME AND SAW THAT THIS MOVIE WAS TWO HOURS LONG
8qrpnFRGt2A_13	BUT THATS JUST ME
8qrpnFRGt2A_12	OK I DONT NEED A THREE HOUR MINI XXX ABOUT JI JOE
8qrpnFRGt2A_15	AND THE LAST BIG THING WAS UM JUST THE THE IT IT I KNOW ITS ABOUT JIJOE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ITS GONNA BE ABOUT THE ARMY BUT IT JUST FELT LIKE UM LIKE UM MILITARY PROPAGANDA KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW
8qrpnFRGt2A_14	I THOUGHT THAT TWO HOURS WAS WAY TOO LONG FOR THIS MOVIE
8qrpnFRGt2A_17	OF COURSE ITS TOO MUCH
8qrpnFRGt2A_16	IT FELL LIKE I WAS WATCHING ONE OF THOSE ARMY OF ONE COMMERCIALS SOMETIMES
8qrpnFRGt2A_19	I I GUESS UM BUT THE FUNNY THING IS UM I MEAN FUNNY THING IS DESPITE AS DESPITE EVERYTHING BAD ABOUT THIS MOVIE I ENDED UP HALF WAY LIKING IT
8qrpnFRGt2A_18	OF COURSE ITS GONNA BE MAKING THEM LOOK GOOD JUST FINE
9J25DZhivz8_24	AND I I ALWAYS THINK THATS HILARIOUS
9J25DZhivz8_25	BUT WHAT MADE THIS MOVIE REALLY FUN WAS SOME OF THE ADULT HUMOUR JABS
9J25DZhivz8_20	I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COOL
9J25DZhivz8_21	THAT WAS A GREAT EFFECT
9J25DZhivz8_22	THERE WAS A LOT OF CHEAP CHILD HUMOUR
9J25DZhivz8_23	WHICH EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO
9J25DZhivz8_1	THIS MOVIE IS ADORABLE
9J25DZhivz8_3	THERE WERE SOME REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE
9J25DZhivz8_2	THIS MOVIE IS JUST TOO ADORABLE
9J25DZhivz8_5	THE VISUALS WERE GREAT
9J25DZhivz8_4	THE VOICE ACTING EXCELLENT
9J25DZhivz8_7	TOY STORY HAD ELEMENTS OF IT BUT THIS MOVIE PLAYED WITH 3D AND UM DIFFERENT WAYS TO COME AT YOU OUT OF THE SCREEN
9J25DZhivz8_6	THIS WAS PROBABLY THE BEST 3D MOVIE IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME COZ IT ACTUALLY USED 3D
9J25DZhivz8_9	THE VOICE ACTING IN THIS WAS INCREDIBLE
9J25DZhivz8_8	SO I LIKED THAT A LOT
9J25DZhivz8_11	OF I COULDNT I COULDNT EVEN BELIEVE IT WAS RUSSELL BRAND
9J25DZhivz8_10	STEVE CARELL VOICES GRU AND RUSSELL BRAND ACTUALLY REALLY IMPRESSED ME WITH HIS OLD MAN VOICE FOR THE DOCTOR
9J25DZhivz8_13	AND THERE WAS MAYBE ONE TIME WHEN I THOUGHT I ACTUALLY HEARD RUSSELL BRAND HIMSELF
9J25DZhivz8_12	I KEPT I WAS LISTENING BORED
9J25DZhivz8_15	AS FOR 3D I SAY YES
9J25DZhivz8_14	BUT OTHERWISE I THOUGHT HE WAS EXCELLENT
9J25DZhivz8_17	AND SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT THERES A LOT OF CHEAP TRICKS
9J25DZhivz8_16	THERES ONE SCENE IN THIS MOVIE THAT MAKES 3D ENTIRELY WORTH IT
9J25DZhivz8_19	I MEAN MY STOMACH WAS ALMOST GOING WOHU AS WE WENT DOWN THE BIG DROP
9J25DZhivz8_18	BUT THERES A ROLLER COASTER SCENE AND IF YOU ARE UM GET A LITTLE BIT MOTION SICK YOU MIGHT NOT WANNA SEE IT IN 3D BECAUSE YOULL FEEL LIKE YOURE ON THIS COASTER
9T9Hf74oK10_24	AND YOU DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHATS GOING ON
9T9Hf74oK10_25	AND I THINK EARLY ON THE TWIST IS REVEALED
9T9Hf74oK10_20	AND YOU DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
9T9Hf74oK10_21	I THINK IT TAKES PLACE SOMETIME UM ITS I DONT THINK ITS PRESENT DAY
9T9Hf74oK10_22	BUT ITS UM ITS SOMEONE MODERN I WOULD SAY
9T9Hf74oK10_23	ITS NOT ITS NOT LIKE A PERIOD PIECE OR ANYTHING
9T9Hf74oK10_1	WATCH THIS FUCKING MOVIE
9T9Hf74oK10_3	I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY SPLIT ABOUT THIS MOVIE
9T9Hf74oK10_2	AND UM PARTICULARLY THE MOVIES THAT I FEEL LIKE SHOULDVE GOTTEN NOMINATED BUT DIDNT AND NEVER LET ME GO IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE MOVIES
9T9Hf74oK10_5	IT WAS A PRETTY SLOW MOVIE FOR THE MOST PART
9T9Hf74oK10_4	THERES A CERTAIN DEADPAN NATURE TO IT
9T9Hf74oK10_7	BUT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERERE CRITICS OF MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES TOO THOUGHFUL IN A WAY AND I THINK THAT WOULD NEVER LET ME GO
9T9Hf74oK10_6	AND IT WAS IT WAS THOUGHFUL
9T9Hf74oK10_9	UM IN A WAY A LOT OF THE THEMES IN NEVER LET ME GO WHICH WERE VERY PROFOUND AND DEEP
9T9Hf74oK10_8	A LOT OF CRITICS SAID THAT IT RELIED TOO MUCH ON THE AUDIENCE TO UM EXPLORE THE THEMES IN THE FILM AND YOU KNOW TIGHTLY SO I GUESS WHICH
9T9Hf74oK10_11	AND I THINK THAT THE MOVIE DID RELY ON YOU TO KIND OF FIGURE IT OUT AND KIND OF DEAL WITH THOSE IDEAS BY YOURSELF
9T9Hf74oK10_10	THEY WERENT FULLY EXPLORED
9T9Hf74oK10_13	THOSE THREE ARE SOME OF THE BEST YOUNG ACTORS OF TODAY
9T9Hf74oK10_12	BUT REGARDLESS I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE
9T9Hf74oK10_15	AND KEIRA KNIGHTLEY I MEAN EVERYBODY KNOWS HER FROM THE PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN
9T9Hf74oK10_14	SHE AND EVERYTHING SHE DOES SHE HAS SO MUCH GRACE TO IT AND SO MUCH FLUIDITY
9T9Hf74oK10_17	AND ANDREW GARFIELD OF COURSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM FORM THE SOCIAL NETWORK
9T9Hf74oK10_16	BUT I MEAN IN HER OTHER WORKS LIKE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE SHES JUST BEEN REALY FANTASTIC
9T9Hf74oK10_19	BUT ANYWAYS THEY DID UM THEY DID ACT VERY WELL
9T9Hf74oK10_18	SO LOOK OUT FOR THAT THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING
9c67fiY0wGQ_11	AND CHILDREN WILL LIKE THE MOVIE
9c67fiY0wGQ_10	PARENTS WILL FIND THEMSELVES LAUGHING AS THEY REMINISCE THEY CHILDHOOD
9c67fiY0wGQ_12	SINCE THE SMURFS ARE SO ADORABLE AND THEY GO ON THRILLING ADVENTURES
9c67fiY0wGQ_1	AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WOULD APPEAL MORE TO YOUNGER AUDIENCE
9c67fiY0wGQ_3	I THINK THE MOVIE REALLY DEPICTED THE LIVELINESS OF NEW YORK CITY WHILE SINCE IM A NEW YORKER MYSELF
9c67fiY0wGQ_2	BUT I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF ENJOYING THE MOVIE AND LAUGHING
9c67fiY0wGQ_5	THE MOVIE ALSO DELIVERS MANY MEANINGFUL MESSAGES
9c67fiY0wGQ_4	I ALSO LIKED HOW THE STORYLINE OF THE MOVIE WORKED TOGETHER SMOOTHLY
9c67fiY0wGQ_7	THEYRE SO HILARIOUS AND SIMILAR TO XXX PERSON WITH THAT
9c67fiY0wGQ_6	I ALSO THOUGHT SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE WERE FUNNY FOR EXAMPLE UM GARGAMELS CAT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
9c67fiY0wGQ_9	IT IS A FUN FAMILY FILM
9c67fiY0wGQ_8	I RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO CHILDREN SIX AND UP
9qR7uwkblbs_24	I WAS KIND OF UPSET ABOUT THAT
9qR7uwkblbs_25	THERES A GIANT ASS TWIST TO THIS MOVIE AT THE END
9qR7uwkblbs_26	LIKE ITS OBVIOSLY NOT LIKE A SERIOUS FUCKING MOVIE OR ANYTHING
9qR7uwkblbs_27	ITS COMEDY ROMANTIC ROMCOM RAOA
9qR7uwkblbs_20	AND SHE DIDNT REALLY ACT LIKE ME AT ALL
9qR7uwkblbs_21	AND I WAS KIND OF UPSET ABOUT IT
9qR7uwkblbs_22	BECAUSE LIKE SHE MUSTVE BEEN AN ANIMAL AND SHE WASNT
9qR7uwkblbs_23	AND I WAS THINKIN LIKE IF I CAN BE MOTHER FUCKING EMMA STONE AND CHRIS CAN BE ROYAN GOSLING AND THAT WOULD BE JUST GREAT DIDNT REALLY HAPPEN IN THE MOVIE
9qR7uwkblbs_28	IM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF FOR NOT REALISING THE TWIST BEFORE IT ACTUALLY TWISTED
9qR7uwkblbs_29	BECAUSE LIKE WHAT THE FUCK LIKE THATS WHAT IM GOOD AT
9qR7uwkblbs_1	OR WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL RAYAN GOSLING LEATHER SHOE AND SUIT PORN
9qR7uwkblbs_3	SO THERES NOT GONNA BE ANY OF BAD SHIT
9qR7uwkblbs_2	BUT I ACTUALLY REALLY FUCKING LOVE THIS MOVIE
9qR7uwkblbs_5	I THINK THAT THAT THEY PERSONALLY THOUGHT THAT RACHEL WITHERS REALLY FUCKING LOVE SUITS AND RYAN GOSLING SO THEY MADE THIS MOVIE WITH ME IN MIND
9qR7uwkblbs_4	SO ANYWAY THE MOVIE WAS REALLY FUCKING AWESOME
9qR7uwkblbs_7	I WISH I WAS RYAN GOSLING
9qR7uwkblbs_6	NO REALLY LIKE RACHEL WHITERS NEEDS SOME FUCKING FAT MATERIAL
9qR7uwkblbs_9	IM NOT GONNA FUCKING SPOIL ANYTHING FOR YOU JUST BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE RUDE
9qR7uwkblbs_8	RYAN GOSLING THE BEST PART IN THE MOVIE
9qR7uwkblbs_11	BEST PART OF THE FUCKING ASS MOVIE WAS THIS ONE SCENE WHERE RYAN GOSLING WAS JUST STANDING THERE IN A FUCKING SUIT EATING PIZZA IN SLOW ASS MOTION
9qR7uwkblbs_10	AND YOU SHOULD ALL GO OUT AND SEE IT AND YOU KNOW STUFF
9qR7uwkblbs_13	EMMA STONE WAS IN THIS MOVIE AS WELL AND YOU WOULDNT REALLY KNOW IT COZ SHE WAS HARDLY IN IT
9qR7uwkblbs_12	THAT WAS JUST LIKE HU LIKE ZOOMING IN ON HIM AND IM JUST LIKE SITTING HERE LIKE ANY MOTHER FUCKERS DROP
9qR7uwkblbs_15	COZ YOU KNOW APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET AKA TUMBLER BECAUSE EVERYONE ON TUMBLER IS ON CRACK THEY ALL THINK I LOOK LIKE HER OR LIKE SOUND LIKE HER OR ACT LIKE HER
9qR7uwkblbs_14	AND I WAS REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT
9qR7uwkblbs_17	LIKE I KIND OF SOUND LIKE I MIGHT HAVE A PENIS
9qR7uwkblbs_16	I DONT KNOW I GUESS WE BOTH HAVE LIKE THAT LIKE MM MALE SOUNDING VOICE
9qR7uwkblbs_19	WE BOTH LIKE FLOOGED IN SHIT
9qR7uwkblbs_18	AND YEAH I KNOW WE BOTH HAVE THAT LIKE AN EASY WAY
9qR7uwkblbs_31	I KNEW THAT INCEPTION THAT THEY WERE GONNA BE DREAMING
9qR7uwkblbs_30	IM GONNA SPOIL SKINS RIGHT NOW I TOTALLY KNEW MANNY AND RICK WERE GONNA BE RELATED I FUCKING KNEW IT LIKE I KNEW IT
9qR7uwkblbs_33	REALLY GOOD SOUNDTRACK
9qR7uwkblbs_32	BUT IT WAS A REALY GOOD MOVIE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_24	THESE TWO DEVELOPMENTS TOGETHER CAUSED WHAT WAS UP TO THAT POINT A NOBLE EFFORT TO START FALLING APART AT THE SEAMS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_25	AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH
Af8D0E4ZXaw_26	I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY I REALLY SHOULD BEGIN WITH LISTING OFF THE NEGATIVES BUT IM GOING TO START WITH A FEW OF THE SUPERFICIAL THINGS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_27	THE ACTING RANGES FROM MEDIOCRITY TO HAMFISTED FROM THE LIVE ACTION ACTORS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_20	AND UM I THOUGHT IT WORKED WORKED PRETTY WELL
Af8D0E4ZXaw_21	UM AND IN FACT IN SPITE OF ALL THE NEGATIVES IM ABOUT TO MENTION I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS WORKING FOR A WHILE FOR ABOUT THE FIRST THIRD UM BUT AT THE END OF ACT ONE TWO SIGNIFICANT THINGS HAPPENED
Af8D0E4ZXaw_22	HACTOR HUMMAND ARRIVES AND STARTS CHEWING SCENERY LIKE ITS A TWO DOLLAR STEAK
Af8D0E4ZXaw_23	AND HOW JORDAN FLIES OFF TO THE GREEN LANTERN CORE PLANET OH AND THE MOVIE STARTS SEQUEL BAITING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_28	BUT I CANT REALLY BLAME THEM FOR THAT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_29	THIS IS STAR WARS PREQUAL TERRITORY
Af8D0E4ZXaw_1	I CANT EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE ADEQUATLY WITHOUT DESCRIBING SOME SPECIFIC THINGS IN THE THIRD ACT OF THE MOVIE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_3	AND PUT THEM IN A JUSTICE LEAGE MOVIE WITH THE RITUAL BATMAN AND SUPERMAN
Af8D0E4ZXaw_2	IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT A SUCESS OF GREEN LANTERN MOVIE WOULD LEAD WARNER BROTHERS TO ADAPT THE FLASH AND WONDER WOMAN AMONG POSSIBLY OTHERS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_5	IT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF POTENTIALLY SETTING UP ALL THAT OTHERS STUFF
Af8D0E4ZXaw_4	SO NOT ONLY THAT THIS MOVIE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BURDEN OF TELLING ITS OWN SELFCONTAINED STORY AND SETTING UP ITS OWN INEVITABLE SEQUELS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_7	TO ALL THE GREEN LANTERN FANS OUT THERE I AM SO SORRY
Af8D0E4ZXaw_6	YEAH NOT GOOD
Af8D0E4ZXaw_9	AND WARNER BROTHERS IS NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU ONE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_8	I SAY THAT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE SOMEONE OWES YOU AN APPOLOGIE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_11	BEFORE I GET TO THE NEGATIVES OF THE MOVIE LET ME LIST OFF A FEW OF THE POSITIVES
Af8D0E4ZXaw_10	AND SECONDLY BECAUSE AS A MARVELL GEEK I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY FAIR SHARE OF DISAPPOINTMENTS OVER THE LAST DECADE AND I CAN GENUINLY SYMPHATIZE WITH YOU
Af8D0E4ZXaw_13	THEY DO A GREAT JOB WITH THEIR ROLES
Af8D0E4ZXaw_12	I LOVE JEFFREY RUSH AND MICHAEL CLARKE DUNCAN AS THE VOICE ACTORS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_15	I ALSO LOVE THE CASTING OF MARK STRONG AS SINESTRO
Af8D0E4ZXaw_14	THEY ARE GREAT ADDITIONS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_17	AND UM FINALLY A PARTICULAR STAND OUT SCENE FOR ME WAS THE FIGHTER JET SEQUENCE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_16	HES PERFECT FOR THAT ROLE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_19	I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY WELL PUT TOGETHER
Af8D0E4ZXaw_18	IT WAS BY FAR MY FAVORITE ACTION SEEN IN THE MOVIE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_31	BUT STILL ITS THAT KIND OF MOVIE MAKING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_30	THE ACTING IS NOT THAT BAD
BI97DNYfe5I_24	BUT UM YEAH GO CHECK IT OUT
BI97DNYfe5I_25	ITS ONE ITS ONE TO CHECK OUT IN THEATERS I WOULD SAY
BI97DNYfe5I_26	UM SNIF BUT YEAH SO THE GREEN HORNET IT WAS OK
BI97DNYfe5I_27	I EXPECTED A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUSNESS
BI97DNYfe5I_20	YOULL HAVE FUN
BI97DNYfe5I_21	AND YOULL LAUGH
BI97DNYfe5I_22	IT IS FUNNY ITS A FUNNY MOVIE
BI97DNYfe5I_23	LOTS OF LOTS OF LAUGH OUT LOUD MOMENT I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
BI97DNYfe5I_28	BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD
BI97DNYfe5I_29	IT GET IT GETS PRETTY SERIOUS
BI97DNYfe5I_1	AND IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
BI97DNYfe5I_3	HE WAS THE SAME OLD GOOFY SETH ROGAN THAT WE ALL KNOW
BI97DNYfe5I_2	UM I WAS EXPECTING SETH ROGAN TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS IN THIS MOVIE BUT HE WASNT
BI97DNYfe5I_5	UM I THINK THAT I MEAN I HAD FUN WITH IT
BI97DNYfe5I_4	UM BUT IT WAS STILL A GOOD FILM
BI97DNYfe5I_7	AND UM BECAUSE OF THAT I WAS EXPECTING SETH ROGAN TO MAYBE TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS BUT HE WASNT
BI97DNYfe5I_6	SO TO ME THATS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE
BI97DNYfe5I_9	UM I STILL HAD FUN WITH IT
BI97DNYfe5I_8	BUT YOU KNOW THATS OK I GUESS
BI97DNYfe5I_11	AND ALL THE ACTION SCENES WERE GREAT
BI97DNYfe5I_10	UM THE CAR THE BLACK BEAUTY THAT WAS AMAZING ALL THE GUNS EVEN THE CAR OVER THERE THAT WAS REALLY SWEET
BI97DNYfe5I_13	UM HE WAS GOOD
BI97DNYfe5I_12	THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GREAT AND THE GUY WHO PLAYED KATO WHOSE FIRST NAME IS J
BI97DNYfe5I_15	AND HE DID A GREAT JOB
BI97DNYfe5I_14	HE PLAYED KATO PERFECTLY
BI97DNYfe5I_17	AND THE ACTION WAS GOOD
BI97DNYfe5I_16	UM THE ACTING WAS WAS PRETTY GOOD
BI97DNYfe5I_19	COZ TAKE A BUNCH OF YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU YOU GUYS WILL HAVE A GOOD TIME
BI97DNYfe5I_18	UM I WOULD DEFINATELLY RECOMMEND YOU GO SEE IT IN THEATERS
BI97DNYfe5I_31	TOO PRETTY INTENSE AT THE END
BI97DNYfe5I_30	AND UM FUN AT THE END
BXuRRbG0Ugk_24	HE IS PERFECT FROM START TO FINSIH
BXuRRbG0Ugk_25	HARISSON FORD IS A LONG FOR THE RIDE AND HAVING A BLAST AS THE SECOND LEAD
BXuRRbG0Ugk_26	AND THE CAST IS PRETTY WELL ROUNDED OUT WITH SUPPORDTING PERFORMANCE FROM GUYS LIKE SAM ROCKWELL AS THE DOC
BXuRRbG0Ugk_27	THEYRE ALL PLAYING CLICHED STOCK WESTERN CHARACTERS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_20	AND THE SAME THING HAS MORE OR LESS HAPPENED HERE YEAH THATS RIGHT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_21	THE MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS DANIEL CRAIG STEELS THE WHOLE DAMN SHOW
BXuRRbG0Ugk_22	HES PLAYING A VARIATION OF THE ICONIC MAN WITH NO NAME CHARACTER THAT WAS MADE FAMOUS BY CLINT EASTWOOD
BXuRRbG0Ugk_23	AND NOW THAT IVE SEEN HIM IN THE ROLE I CANT IMAGINE ANY OTHER CURRENT ACTOR TRYING OT PULL IT OFF
BXuRRbG0Ugk_28	BUT I REALLY DONT CARE THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE WALKING CLICHES WHEN THEY ARE THIS WELL DONE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_29	AND THE ACTORS DO SUCH A GOOD JOB OF CARRYING OF THEIR PARTICULAR ARCS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_1	COWBOYS AND ALIENS METAPHORICALY SPEAKING IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE NFL TEAMS THAT HAS THE TALENT TO BE A SUPER BOWL CHAMPION BUT INSTEAD ENDS UP BEING A WILD CART TEAM THAT JUST GETS DISMISSED IN THE FIRST ROUND OF PLAYOFFS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_3	I MEAN IT WASNT A BAD YEAR
BXuRRbG0Ugk_2	YEAH JOB PRETTY WELL DONE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_5	AND THAT DESCRIBES COWBOYS AND ALIENS PRETTY WELL
BXuRRbG0Ugk_4	BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL LEFT ON THE TABLE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_7	BECAUSE GIVEN ALL THE STRIKES THAT IT HAD GOING AGAINST BEFORE WONDER PRODUCTION IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH WORSE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_6	THOUGH I GUESS I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT IT TURNED OUT AS GOOD AS IT DID
BXuRRbG0Ugk_9	BUT THIS PROBABLY HAD THE UNFORTUNATE SIDE EFFECT OF RAISING BAD EXPECTATIONS TO UNREASONABLE LEVELS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_8	FORTUNALLY SOME GOOD DECISIONS WERE MADE BEFORE THE CAMARA STARTED ROLLING
BXuRRbG0Ugk_11	THE FINAL PRODUCT ULTIMATELY DOESNT LIVE UP TO THE HIGH ORDER OF THAT FIRST TRAILER
BXuRRbG0Ugk_10	WHEN I SAW THE FIRST TRAILER BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY SHOT UP NEAR THE TOP OF MY LIST OF MUST SEE MOVIES FOR 2011
BXuRRbG0Ugk_13	BUT IF THATS ALL YOURE LOOKING FOR YOULL ACTUALLY MISS THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_12	BUT ITS STILL A PRETTY ENJOYABLE RIDE IF YOU GO IN WANTING TO SEE A BUNCH OF COWBOYS BATTLE A BUNCH OF ALIENS YEAH YOULL PRETTY MUCH GET YOUR FILL
BXuRRbG0Ugk_15	I MEAN YEAH HES A COMPETENT ACTION DIRECTOR
BXuRRbG0Ugk_14	JON FAVREAU IS PROBABLY NOT THE GUY THAT I WOULD HIRE IF I WAS LOOKING FOR A DIRECTOR FOR AN ACTION MOVIE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_17	BUT ITS ACTION ISNT PARTICULARY MEMORABLE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_16	HES ACTION SEQUENCES ARE CERTAINLY A LOT BETTER THAN THE INCOHERENT IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW SLOPE THAT WE SEE IN A TYPICAL MICHAEL BAY MOVIE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_19	THE IRONMAN FILMS ARE FONDLY REMEMBERED MOSTLY FOR ROBERT DOWENY JR NOT THE ACTION
BXuRRbG0Ugk_18	AND THE ACTION WASNT THE MOST MEMORABLE THING ABOUT ANY ON THOSE MOVIES
BXuRRbG0Ugk_31	SIX DIFFERENT PEOPLE GOT WRITING CREDIT FOR THIS MOVIE AND THE RESULTS ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_30	COWBOYS AND ALIENS PROBLEM IS THE SCREENPLAY
Bfr499ggo-0_20	THE WRITING ISNT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST
Bfr499ggo-0_21	THE STORYLINE ISNT THIS GOOD
Bfr499ggo-0_22	BUT IF YOU DONT EXPECT A LOT I THINK YOULL ENJOY IT
Bfr499ggo-0_1	SNAP MOST OF THE CRITICS ARE RIGHT
Bfr499ggo-0_3	BUT IF YOU LOVED THE SERIES AND YOU ALSO LIKED XXX THE FIRST MOVIE THAN YOURE STILL GONNA HAVE FUN
Bfr499ggo-0_2	IT JUST REALLY HEH
Bfr499ggo-0_5	IF YOUR PET PEES CARRIE WORE THOSE HORRENDOUS HIDEOUS HATS THEY WERE NOT CATCHING THE BALL
Bfr499ggo-0_4	JUST GO IN WITH LOW EXPECTAIONS
Bfr499ggo-0_7	A FEW TIMES I THOUGHT THAT WAS BUMPED WAY OVER THE TOP
Bfr499ggo-0_6	AND A FEW TIMES I DIDNT LIKE THE FASHION
Bfr499ggo-0_9	UM BUT YOU KNOW THE PREMISE IS OK
Bfr499ggo-0_8	AND THEY KIND OF LOOKED LIKE CLOWNS THE DESERT SCENE WAS ONE OF THEM
Bfr499ggo-0_11	THE MOVIE IS REALLY TOO LONG
Bfr499ggo-0_10	AND THERE ARE A FEW NICE MOMENTS
Bfr499ggo-0_13	ITS NOT EVEN NECESSARY FOR THE PLOT
Bfr499ggo-0_12	THEY SHOULDVE JUST CUT THE WEDDING IN THE BEGINNING
Bfr499ggo-0_15	BUT ALSO NOT NECESSARY
Bfr499ggo-0_14	I ALSO THOUGHT THAT DESERT RIDING THE CAMELS ALL TROUP STOPPED LOOKING LIKE CLOWNS
Bfr499ggo-0_17	AND UM IT WAS JUST FUN TO SEE YOUR OLD FRIENDS AGAIN
Bfr499ggo-0_16	BUT I LOVE THE MOMENT WITH CHARLOTTE IN THE CLOSET BECAUSE WHO HASNT EXPERIENCED THAT
Bfr499ggo-0_19	BUT DONT EXPECT MUCH
Bfr499ggo-0_18	SO IF YOUR A FAN ID DO IT
BioHAh1qJAQ_24	AND ITS JUST LIKE OR WHY DO WE NEED THESE THINGS
BioHAh1qJAQ_25	IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE
BioHAh1qJAQ_26	BECAUSE WHEN THE OLD FLYNN FINDS THESE THINGS WHATEVER THEY ARE THEYRE SO WISE AND NAIVE KINDA LIKE NAVI NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT
BioHAh1qJAQ_27	CLUE WHICH IS THE PROGRAM THAT HE CREATED IN THE FIRST MOVIE KINDA PULLS A BUNNY IN THE BOILER MOMENT IN THE SENSE THAT HE TURNS INTO A CRAZY JEALOUS PSYCHO STALKER BITCH
BioHAh1qJAQ_20	BUT THEN SAM FLYNN MEETS HIS FATHER AND TRON BASICALLY TURNS INTO A STAR WARS PREQUEL AFTER THAT ONE
BioHAh1qJAQ_21	DISCONNECTION THEN THAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT
BioHAh1qJAQ_22	THE WRITERS JUST PULL THIS OUT OF THEIR ASS
BioHAh1qJAQ_23	AND THE WHOLE MOVIE BECOMES ABOUT THESE CRAZY I I ISOS
BioHAh1qJAQ_28	AND CLUE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IDIOTIC VILLAINS EVER CAUSE WHAT IS A WHAT IS CLUE
BioHAh1qJAQ_29	FOR SOME KIND OF FREAKY TELEPORTATION
BioHAh1qJAQ_1	IM A BIG FAN OF THE FIRST TRON
BioHAh1qJAQ_3	BECAUSE UM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 1980S PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT COMPUTERS CAN DO EVERY EVERY ANYTHING
BioHAh1qJAQ_2	UM I THOUGHT THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO HAVE A TRON SEQUEL
BioHAh1qJAQ_5	BECAUSE IT KINDA CONTROLS OUR LIVES SO IT WAS THE PERFECT TIME FOR A TRON SEQUEL
BioHAh1qJAQ_4	AND EVERYTHING AND NOW TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY DOES ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING
BioHAh1qJAQ_7	LIP SMACKING BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE FIRST THIRD OF THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING
BioHAh1qJAQ_6	UNFORTUNATELY UM THE WRITERS AND I WERE NOT EXACTLY ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH
BioHAh1qJAQ_9	BUT YOU KNOW THE PACING IS SO GOOD
BioHAh1qJAQ_8	ITS THE BEST SUMMER MOVIE IVE SEEN ALL YEAR
BioHAh1qJAQ_11	YOU HAVE LOTS OF UH REFERENCES TO THE FIRST MOVIE
BioHAh1qJAQ_10	IT GETS STRAIGHT INTO THE STORY
BioHAh1qJAQ_13	AND ONCE SAM FLYNN ENTERS THE GRID YOU KNOW THE SOUNDTRACK DRAWS YOU IN
BioHAh1qJAQ_12	YOU HAVE NEW CHARACTERS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE OLD ONES
BioHAh1qJAQ_15	UH THEY DONT WASTE A LOT OF TIME ON EXPOSITION
BioHAh1qJAQ_14	THE SPECIAL EFFECTS LOOK AMAZING
BioHAh1qJAQ_17	AND LET ME TELL YOU THE GAMES LOOK GREAT
BioHAh1qJAQ_16	BECAUSE THE MINUTE THE SOUNDPLANE ENTERS THE GRID HE IS PUT IN THE GAMES
BioHAh1qJAQ_19	UM THE CHO THE CHOREOGRAPHY OF THE FIGHTS THE SPECIAL EFFECTS I WAS SO HAPPY TO BE BACK IN THE GRID THAT I WASNT REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE STORY OR WHERE THE STORY WAS GOING
BioHAh1qJAQ_18	ALL THOSE ACTION SEQUENCES IN INVOLVING THE GAMES WERE GREAT TO WATCH
BioHAh1qJAQ_30	AND ITS LIKE YOURE A COMPUTER PROGRAM OKAY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD USING REAL PEOPLE ITS THE WORST WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT INFILTRATE SOME COMPUTER SYSTEM SOMEWHERE AND DETONATE SOME NUKES OR SOMETHING
BvYR0L6f2Ig_24	SHE DISPLAYS THE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS OF HER CHARACTER SO WELL
BvYR0L6f2Ig_25	YOU ACTUALLY FEEL FOR HER CHARACTER
BvYR0L6f2Ig_26	YOU KNOW SHES GOING THROUGH THE STRESS AND YOU FEEL SORRY FOR HER AND YOU WANNA HELP HER
BvYR0L6f2Ig_20	OLSO THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES IVE EVER SEEN OUT OF HERS
BvYR0L6f2Ig_21	IVE NOT SEEN ONE BAD MOVIE THAT SHES BEEN INTO
BvYR0L6f2Ig_22	TERIFFIC IN THAT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_23	BUT MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD I MUST SAY SHE IS A TERIFFIC AND BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED ACRESS
BvYR0L6f2Ig_1	I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS WORK ON THE FIRST ONE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_3	BUT THE SECOND ONE IT DIDNT IN SOME WAYS TAKE TO THE NEXT LEVEL
BvYR0L6f2Ig_2	I THOUGHT THE FIRST ONE WAS CREATIVE AND INVENTIVE AND REALLY BROUGHT SOMETHING NEW TO THE CINEMA
BvYR0L6f2Ig_5	SO IT WAS JUST ABOUT EQUAL TO THE FIRST ONE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_4	BUT IN SOME WAYS THE FIRST ONE WAS BETTER
BvYR0L6f2Ig_7	NOW UM BUT SOME OF THE BRUSH PLOT THAT YOU MEY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE BUT YOURE WRONG ACTUALLY I DID
BvYR0L6f2Ig_6	NOW UM BUT SOME OF THE BRUSH PLOT THAT YOU MEY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_9	FIRST IM GONNA GET INTO THE ACTING WHICH WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE SECOND ONE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_8	I REALLY LIKED IT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_11	I DID LIKE THE SECOND ONE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_10	THE SECOND ONE HAD WOODEN ACTING IN SOME PLACES IM SORRY
BvYR0L6f2Ig_13	BUT THE REST OF THE ACTORS WERE SO WOODEN
BvYR0L6f2Ig_12	BUT THERE MOST OF THE ACTORS WE SO WITTY EXEPTION MAY BE THE POLICE COP AND KIM KIMBERLY
BvYR0L6f2Ig_15	I DONT KNOW THEY DO SEEM THEY NEED TO LEARN ACTING BETTER
BvYR0L6f2Ig_14	THEY WERE JUST THEYRE JUST THEY JUST WHY ACTING WHAT THEYRE DOING ANYWAY
BvYR0L6f2Ig_17	ANYWAY MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD OH MY GOD SHE IS A TERIFFIC
BvYR0L6f2Ig_16	ANYWAY THE FURTHER I WENT ACTING WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER IN THE SECOND ONE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_19	BUT SHE IS ALSO A TERIFFIC ACTRESS
BvYR0L6f2Ig_18	SHES NICE LOOKING AS WELL
Ci-AH39fi3Y_42	IT WAS PRETTY MUCH JUST AND EXCUSE TO PUT TRAPS IN THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_43	LIKE I SAID I LOVED THE HOFFMANS STORYLINE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_24	BUT THE END WAS REALLY YOU YOU KNOW
Ci-AH39fi3Y_25	BUT I THOUGHT THE BEST PART OF SAW 5 WAS THE STORYLINE LIKE IN GENERAL
Ci-AH39fi3Y_26	THE ENDING WAS NOT YOU KNOW CRAZY SHOCKING OR ANYTHING LIKE USUAL
Ci-AH39fi3Y_27	IT WAS NOT A REAL HUGE SAW TWIST MOMENT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_20	BUT LUCKILY HOFFMANS STORY UM WAS A REALLY REALLY REALLY AWESOME
Ci-AH39fi3Y_21	AND UM IT TOTALLY MADE UP FOR THAT SO THATS OK
Ci-AH39fi3Y_22	AND I GUESS THATS SORT OF TRUE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_23	BECAUSE I SURE DIDNT SEE THE END COMING
Ci-AH39fi3Y_44	SO YOU KNOW I GUESS IT BALANCES OUT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_28	UM SO YOU KNOW THAT WAS A LITTLE SURPRISING I GUESS
Ci-AH39fi3Y_29	THATS NOT TO SAY THAT THE ENDING WASNT GOOD BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS
Ci-AH39fi3Y_40	BUT ILL SMACK THEM IN THE FACE FOR THE OTHER IRRELEVANT PLOTLINE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_41	AND DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE THINKING
Ci-AH39fi3Y_1	BECAUSE IM STILL EXCITED ABOUT IT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_3	OK ALL OF YOU KNEW THAT OBVIOUSLY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_2	AS SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE I WAS EXTREMLY EXCITED ABOUT SAW 5
Ci-AH39fi3Y_5	AND EXCITED TO SEE IT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_4	SO I WAS YOU KNOW REALLY HYPED UP
Ci-AH39fi3Y_7	NOT EXECTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
Ci-AH39fi3Y_6	AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT WAS DEFINATELY BETTER THAN THE SAW 4
Ci-AH39fi3Y_9	AND UM ITS JUST MADE ME REALLY REALLY EXCIDED FOR SAW 6
Ci-AH39fi3Y_8	BUT IT WAS STILL REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD
Ci-AH39fi3Y_39	SO CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WRITERS FOR THAT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_38	AND IT FIT VERY WELL INTO THE SAW SERIES IN MY OPINION
Ci-AH39fi3Y_11	AND THE OTHER ONE WAS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
Ci-AH39fi3Y_10	ONE OF THEM WAS GREAT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_13	AND THE IRRELEVANT PLOT WAS WITH FIVE RENDOM STRANGERS
Ci-AH39fi3Y_12	THE GREAT PLOT WAS WITH HOFFMAN TYING UP ALL LOOSE ENDS AND STUFF
Ci-AH39fi3Y_15	BUT I TOTALLY MISSED HOW IT TIED IT TO THE MOVIE AT ALL
Ci-AH39fi3Y_14	KIND OF LIKE IN SAW 2
Ci-AH39fi3Y_17	SO THAT WAS REALLY BIZZARE AND I DIDNT CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AT ALL
Ci-AH39fi3Y_16	AND IM PRETTY SURE THATS BECAUSE IT DIDNT TIE IN TO THE MOVIE AT ALL
Ci-AH39fi3Y_19	SO IT WAS JUST REALLY REALLY STRANGE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_18	BECAUSE THEY WERENT YOU KNOW INTRODUCED WELL REALLY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_31	WHICH IS STILL GOOD
Ci-AH39fi3Y_30	BUT IT WAS NOT EXECTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING AND SE SERIOUSLY EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO THE END WAS BETTER THAN THE ENDING
Ci-AH39fi3Y_37	BUT LIKE I SAID THE PLOT OF HOFFMAN AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS REALLY REALLY AWESOME
Ci-AH39fi3Y_36	AND IT DIDNT EVEN YOU KNOW TRY TO CLOSE IT AT ALL LIKE THE WIND ISNT GONNA BLOW IT OVER OR ANYTHING ITS JUST OPEN
Ci-AH39fi3Y_35	BUT MAN OH MAN IT REALLY LEFT THE DOOR OPEN
Ci-AH39fi3Y_34	AND IT PRETTY MUCH JUST LEFT THE DOOR WIDE OPEN FOR SAW 6
Ci-AH39fi3Y_33	SAW 5 HAS LEFT LIKE NO CLOSURE AT ALL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_32	BECAUSE THE MOVIE IS GOOD
Clx4VXItLTE_24	HAH SO EVERYONE LIKE EVERYONE IN CINEMA WAS KIND LIKE ME
Clx4VXItLTE_25	BECAUSE EVERYTIME THAT WAS LIKE A JUMP EVERYONE JUMPED
Clx4VXItLTE_26	YOU COULD FEEL THE JUMP IN
Clx4VXItLTE_27	AND EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING AFTERWARDS
Clx4VXItLTE_20	AND I WOULD GO TO THE CINEMA AGAIN TO SEE IT
Clx4VXItLTE_21	BECAUSE THAT ATMOSPHERE LIKE EVERYONE JUST SCREEAMS
Clx4VXItLTE_22	AND JUST AND ITS JUST ITS SO FUNNY
Clx4VXItLTE_23	UM SOMETHING LIKE WHAT I DO LIKE IF I JUMP A LOT
Clx4VXItLTE_28	I THINK THATS HOW THEY COPE WITH GETTING JUM LIKE SCARED AND JUMP AND STUFF
Clx4VXItLTE_29	FROM THERE IT DOES GET A BIT LIKE HUH NOT AS REAL AS WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON
Clx4VXItLTE_1	AND IT IS JUMPY FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT LIKE GETTING SCARED OR JUMPY OR ANYTHING
Clx4VXItLTE_3	AND LIKE I DO JUMP
Clx4VXItLTE_2	BUT FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO LOVES HORROR MOVIES
Clx4VXItLTE_5	SO I THINK IM LIKE IMMUNE TO THEM
Clx4VXItLTE_4	BUT I DONT EXACTLY GET SCARED
Clx4VXItLTE_7	I JUST THATS FREAKY AS HELL YEHA
Clx4VXItLTE_6	AND THE ONLY HE MO FILM THAT IM REALLY SCARED ABOUT IS SMALL SOLDIERS
Clx4VXItLTE_9	LIKE IT CRACKED ON STREIGHT AWAY WITH WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
Clx4VXItLTE_8	BUT INSIDIOUS UM STAR REALLY GOOD
Clx4VXItLTE_11	AND SOME OF THE ACTING IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE OH MY GOD YOU WOULDNT REALLY DO THAT
Clx4VXItLTE_10	LIKE IT DOSNT JUST LIKE AND I WAS AT UM THERES A PROBLEM THERES A STORY LIKE ADN ITS LIKE STREIGHT AWAY FUN STORYLINE STARTED
Clx4VXItLTE_13	BUT ITS JUST SOMETIMES ITS JUST A LITTLE BIT LIKE OH GOD THEY REALY SHOULDNT HAVE DONE THAT CRINGE
Clx4VXItLTE_12	BUT THATS LIKE OLD MOVIES ITS JUST LIKE I WOULDNT SAY BAD CASTING
Clx4VXItLTE_15	LIKE REALLY JUMPED ME MY FRIEND
Clx4VXItLTE_14	UM BUT REALLY GOOD
Clx4VXItLTE_17	BUT IT REALLY SURPRISED AS I SAID WHAT YOU WANNA GO HOME
Clx4VXItLTE_16	AND SHE WANTED TO GO HOME AND THATS LIKE SEEING A LOT FOR HER COZ SHE LIKES HORROR MOVIES AS MUCH AS I DO
Clx4VXItLTE_19	I JUMPED HELL OF A LOT TIMES
Clx4VXItLTE_18	HUH BUT I AM IT WAS JUMPY
Clx4VXItLTE_31	BECAUSE THERE IS PEOPLE THAT WANNA GO AND SEE IT HAVENT SEEN IT YET AND MIGHT SEE THIS VIDEO
Clx4VXItLTE_30	ITS KIND OF LIKE QUITE FAKE LIKE I JUST I COULDNT BELIEVE IT I WAS LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_11	BUT OVERALL I ENJOYED IT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_10	WHOEVER WROTE THIS ISNT THE WRITER DEFINATELLY
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_13	UM AND THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY SHORT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_12	THE THE WHOLE MOVIE I WAS YOU KNOW THINKING THIS ISN AS BAD AS IVE HEARD AND IT WASNT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_15	OTHER THAN THAT UM I THINK IT WAS AND OK MOVIE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_14	AND THE DIALOGUE THREW ME OFF
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_17	I DONT THINK ITS AS BAD AS YOU PROBABLY READ ON REVIEWS
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_16	DEFINATELLY A LITTLE BIT ABOVE AVERAGE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_18	SO YEAH GO SEE IT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_1	I MEAN IT STARTS OUT REALLY SLOW
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_3	IT WAS A COOL MOVIE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_2	BUT OVERALL UM GO SEE IT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_5	UM I THOUGHT THEY CASTED KIND OF WELL
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_4	THE ACTING WAS ALLRIGHT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_7	OH MY GOD THE WHOLE MOVIE HAD A REALLY DRY DIALOGUE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_6	BUT WHAT REALLY THREW ME OFF WAS THE DIALOGUE VERY CHEEZY DIALOGUE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_9	BUT I DONT THINK THE HUMOUR REDEEMED THE MOVIE FROM BEING SO BAD IN THE DIALOGUE DEPARTMENT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_8	THERE WERE A COUPLE FUNNY PARTS
G-xst2euQUc_11	UM IT HAS IT HAS A VERY PREDICTABLE STORY
G-xst2euQUc_10	AND AGAIN IT DOES REALLY TUG AT THE HEART STRENGHTS WITH THE LITTLE BABY ANIMALS AT THE BEGINNING
G-xst2euQUc_13	BUT IF IT WAS ANNE HATHAWAY WHO DID THE SINGING SHE DID A GREAT JOB
G-xst2euQUc_12	THAT SO WHAT IS STILL A REALLY GREAT MOVIE TO TAKE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO
G-xst2euQUc_15	ANYWAY UM I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF IF YOURE LIKE ME AND YOU DONT NORMALLY GO TO SEE ANIMATED MOVIES
G-xst2euQUc_14	I HAD NO IDEA THAT ANNE HATHAWAY COULD REALLY SING
G-xst2euQUc_17	UM BUT THERE REALLY HASNT BEEN MUCH TO HAS COME OUT THIS YEAR SO FAR THAT IM DYING TO GO SEE
G-xst2euQUc_16	AND IM IM NOT REALLY IN A BIG HURRY AT MY AGE TO GO SEE ANIMATED MOVIES
G-xst2euQUc_19	AND I WAS THOROUGHLY UM SURPRISED
G-xst2euQUc_18	AND WE REALLY WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE UM LAST NIGHT
G-xst2euQUc_20	AT HOW MUCH I REALLY DID ENJOY IT
G-xst2euQUc_1	ANYWAYIT WAS A REALLY CUTE MOVIE
G-xst2euQUc_3	I REALLY DIDNT WANNA GO SEE IT
G-xst2euQUc_2	I DID NOT THINK I WAS GONNA LIKE IT
G-xst2euQUc_5	AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THIS MOVIE
G-xst2euQUc_4	AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAN WHEN PRODUCTION COMPANIES START PUSHING MOVIES THAT FAR AHEAD AND WHEN THEY WERE GONNA BE RELEASED THAT USAUALLY MEANS THAT THEY ARE NOT GONNA BE GREAT
G-xst2euQUc_7	UM THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE TO TAKE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO THIS MOVIE
G-xst2euQUc_6	I WAS I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT
G-xst2euQUc_9	UM I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE WAS REALLY CUTE
G-xst2euQUc_8	ITS GREAT FOR ALL AGES
G-xst2euQUc_21	SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_24	UM BUT THEY ALSO DID A GREAT JOB IN BUILDING THE BACKSTORY OF JANE FOSTER PLAYED BY NATALIE PORTMAN AND HER CREW AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THOR
G6GlGvlkxAQ_25	SO I THINK THAT WAS REALLY GOOD
G6GlGvlkxAQ_26	THEY DIDNT BELABORED THOR ON EARTH
G6GlGvlkxAQ_27	HE SOUNDED LIKE HE DIDNT LEARN FROM THE EARTHLINGS
G6GlGvlkxAQ_20	OR WHY WHY ARE THEY HERE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_21	YOU HAVE TO ESTABLSIH THAT FAIRLY QUICKLY
G6GlGvlkxAQ_22	AND I THINK THAT DIRECTORS OF THOR AND THE SCRIPT WRITERS DID THAT RIGHT AWAY
G6GlGvlkxAQ_23	YOU SAW THOR FOR HOW HES IN THE COMICS POMPOUS AN AROGANT INDIVIDUAL
G6GlGvlkxAQ_28	UM SO THAT MAKES SENSE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_29	YOU GET OTHER WHOLE SHIELD INVOLVEMENT WHICH IS COOL TO SEE THAT A LOT OF COOLER REFERENCES THAT AT ONE POINT THEY REFERENCE IM A DOCTOR WITH GAMA RADIATION
G6GlGvlkxAQ_1	I WOULD PUT MONEY ON IT THAT IT IS GOING TO BE THE BLOCKBUSTER HIT OF THE SUMMER IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE MOVIES
G6GlGvlkxAQ_3	I THINK THAT WOULD DO VERY WELL
G6GlGvlkxAQ_2	I IM A CAP GUY CAPTAIN AMERICA FAN
G6GlGvlkxAQ_5	I THINK ITS GONNA CATAPULT CHRIS HEMSWORTH TO BE EVEN A BIGGER STAR
G6GlGvlkxAQ_4	UM SO I THINK THOR IS REALLY GONNA DO WELL
G6GlGvlkxAQ_7	CHARLIE SHEEN WAS WINNING THERE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_6	UM GREAT 80S MOVIE FOR THOSE WHO HAVENT SEEN IT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_9	SO THEY COULD UM UM KIND OF GET A LITTLE BIT OF CHRIS HEMSWORTH STAR POWER INTO THAT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_8	AND HES WINNING NO
G6GlGvlkxAQ_11	THEY DID VERY WELL TO ESTABLISH THE CHARACTER OF THOR
G6GlGvlkxAQ_10	UM GREAT MOVIE OVERALL
G6GlGvlkxAQ_13	AND YOU SAW THIS WITH THE NBC RECENT FLOP OF THE CAPE WHICH IS A SHOW I LOVE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_12	THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF COMIC BOOK SHOWS AND MOVIES
G6GlGvlkxAQ_15	AND THEY NEEDED CHARACTER ESTABLISHED RIGHT AWAY
G6GlGvlkxAQ_14	BUT THE AUDIENCE THAT WAS WATCHING IT THEY NEEDED THEY NEEDED A PAY OFF RIGHT AWAY
G6GlGvlkxAQ_17	AND WHY IS THIS PERSON WEARING TIGHTS
G6GlGvlkxAQ_16	UM WHAT YOU GET IN THE SITCOMS IN TERMS OF COMIC BOOKS AND KIND OF THE MOVIES THAT TAKE SO LOUD TO BUILD THAT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_19	YOU KNOW WHY WHAT IS THEIR MISSION
G6GlGvlkxAQ_18	OR WHY ARE THEY CARRYING A HAMMER
GWuJjcEuzt8_11	ITS SEXY BUT NOT SLUTTY
GWuJjcEuzt8_10	THAT THE DANCERS UM WONDERFUL
GWuJjcEuzt8_13	UM THE SONGS IN THE MOVIE ARE WONDERFUL
GWuJjcEuzt8_12	WHO IS DROP DEAD GORGEOUS BY THE WAY
GWuJjcEuzt8_15	AND OVERALL PROBABLY ID GIVE IT ABOUT 35 STARS YOU KNOW POPCORN MOVIE AND YOU KNOW
GWuJjcEuzt8_14	YOU KNOW IT MATCHES THE WHOLE THEME OF THE MOVIE YOU KNOW CABARET AND YOU KNOW THE LOOKS
GWuJjcEuzt8_17	THIS ONE YOU KNOW PROBABLY IN THE MIDDLE SO 35 STARS
GWuJjcEuzt8_16	CONSIDERING ALL THE AWESOME MOVIES THAT WE HAD AND XXX INCEPTION THE BLACK SWAN AND YOU KNOW THE SOCIAL NETWORK
GWuJjcEuzt8_18	AND IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO SPEND GO AHEAD
GWuJjcEuzt8_1	UM FIRST THINGS FIRST CHRISTINA AGUILERAS XXX I SWEAR THE XXX XXX
GWuJjcEuzt8_3	AND SHE SURE CAN SING REALLY REALLY WELL IN THIS MOVIE YOU KNOW
GWuJjcEuzt8_2	UM WHY I SAID THAT IS BECAUSE SHE IS GOD A CRAZY CRAZY VOICE
GWuJjcEuzt8_5	BUT SHE STILL LOOKS LIKE SHES 48
GWuJjcEuzt8_4	AND YOU KNOW IT MAKES YOU WANNA KNOW WHO ELSE YOU KNOW IN THE HISTORY OF NOWADAYS HAS THE VOICE LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW ITS NOONE
GWuJjcEuzt8_7	COZ WHEN YOU SEE HER FACE MOVES IT FEELS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU FEEL WORRIED FOR HER
GWuJjcEuzt8_6	AND HER FACE DOESNT MOVE AT ALL
GWuJjcEuzt8_9	AND OVERALL THE MOVIES QUITE ENTERTAINING
GWuJjcEuzt8_8	YOU FEEL LIKE HER FACE IS GOING TO FALL APART
HEsqda8_d0Q_24	BUT IM REALLY REALLY REALLY GLAD I SAW IT
HEsqda8_d0Q_25	AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHER PEOPLE ITS TRUE
HEsqda8_d0Q_26	EVEN THOUGH I WAS LIKE HU IM GONNA HATE IT
HEsqda8_d0Q_27	BUT IM JUST GONNA HAVE TO SAY IT
HEsqda8_d0Q_20	BUT YEAH GENERALLY THE ACCENTS WERE REALLY REALLY GOOD
HEsqda8_d0Q_21	SO GOOD ONE YOU AMERICA FOR DOING THAT
HEsqda8_d0Q_22	I DOUBT THAT THEYRE GONNA DO THIS FOR ALL THE SCREENINGS BECAUSE IT WAS THE PREMIERE
HEsqda8_d0Q_23	I WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN TO GO AND SEE THAT
HEsqda8_d0Q_28	ITS MY FAVORITE FILM EVER
HEsqda8_d0Q_29	UM ITS NOT MY FAVORITE FILM EVER
HEsqda8_d0Q_1	IT WAS AMAZING
HEsqda8_d0Q_3	AND I ACTUALLY LIKED THE FILM A LOT
HEsqda8_d0Q_2	THE PREMIERE ITSELF WAS REALLY COOL
HEsqda8_d0Q_5	BECAUSE I THOUGHT HOW THE HELL IS DICKENS AND DISNEY GONNA WORK TOGETHER LIKE THIS
HEsqda8_d0Q_4	AND I WASNT EXPECTING TO
HEsqda8_d0Q_7	AND THE END PART IS REALLY REALLY FUNNY
HEsqda8_d0Q_6	BUT I THOUGHT THEY ACTUALLY WORKED PRETTY WELL
HEsqda8_d0Q_9	HES LIKE WHAT A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
HEsqda8_d0Q_8	BECAUSE HES BEEN SUCH A GRUMPY CHARACTER AND HES REALLY SCARED AND IN THE END HES SO CHANGED AND HES REALLY FUNNY
HEsqda8_d0Q_11	THE ANIMATION WAS AMAZING
HEsqda8_d0Q_10	AND ITS ALL KIND OF ITS HARD TO EXPLAIN
HEsqda8_d0Q_13	BECAUSE SOMETIMES 3D ISNT REALLY THAT GOOD
HEsqda8_d0Q_12	I WASNT EXPECTING THAT MUCH
HEsqda8_d0Q_15	YOU KIND OF FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT IS 3D
HEsqda8_d0Q_14	BUT IT WAS FENOMENAL
HEsqda8_d0Q_17	THAT WAS ONE OF MY OTHER CONCERNS
HEsqda8_d0Q_16	THE VOICES ARE REALLY GOOD
HEsqda8_d0Q_19	BUT THAN ITS SO OBVIOUSLY NOT AN ENGLISH CHARACTER
HEsqda8_d0Q_18	WAS THAT AS AN ENGLISH PERSON I GET REALLY ANNOYED WHEN AMERICAN SHOWS AND FILMS HAVE AN ENGLISH CHARACTER
HEsqda8_d0Q_31	I CAN IMAGINE GETTING THIS ON DVD AND WATCHING IT AT CHRISTMAS AT TIME BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL SO LIKE HUH ITS NOT ABOUT COMMERCIALIZATION ITS ABOUT YOU KNOW FAMILIES BEING TOGETHER
HEsqda8_d0Q_30	BUT I WOULD DEFINATELY WATCH IT AGAIN
HEsqda8_d0Q_34	WHICH WERE UM A DISASTEROUS
HEsqda8_d0Q_33	BUT I JUST WANTED TO PUT THIS UP SOON
HEsqda8_d0Q_32	AND ILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT LIKE THE COOL PREMIERE AND STUFF
I5y0__X72p0_24	THERES NOT LIKE A REALLY GOOD TWIST
I5y0__X72p0_25	ITS A GOOD ACTION MOVIE
I5y0__X72p0_26	ITS LIKE 90 BOURNE IDENTITY MEETS 10 WILLY WONKA
I5y0__X72p0_27	THERES SOME REALLY STRANGE CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE
I5y0__X72p0_20	BECAUSE I WENT INTO THE MOVIE THINKING THERES NO WAY
I5y0__X72p0_21	AND SO THEY KIND OF EXPLAIN IT A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT REALLY
I5y0__X72p0_22	UM I I AT THE END OF THE MOVIE THE FRIENDS I WAS WITH UH ONE OF THEM GOES WAS THERE A PLOT TO THIS MOVIE
I5y0__X72p0_23	IT DOESNT HAVE A DEEP SEEDED PLOT
I5y0__X72p0_28	IT WAS IT DID ADD TO THE MOVIE THOUGH IT
I5y0__X72p0_29	AND IT VISUALLY ITS KINDA COOL HOW THEY SHOW HER CONFUSION BECAUSE SHE GROWS UP IN THE WOODS
I5y0__X72p0_1	AND I WAS PRETTY OPEN TO TO IT BEING GOOD
I5y0__X72p0_3	I WAS LIKE THERES NO WAY THAT THEYRE GONNA BE ABLE TO CONVINCE ME THAT A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL CAN TAKE DOWN LIKE SIX ADULT DUDES
I5y0__X72p0_2	I AT FIRST WHEN I SAW THE PREVIEWS I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE STUPID TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
I5y0__X72p0_5	AND THEY BOTH LIKED IT
I5y0__X72p0_4	SO I SAW SOME OTHER REVIEWS AND I WAS LIKE OKAY I WAS SURPRISED
I5y0__X72p0_7	AND I GOTTA SAY I WASNT BLOWN AWAY BY IT
I5y0__X72p0_6	THEY S AND ALL THE PEOPLE WALKING OUT OF THE THEATRE AND BEYOND THE TRAILER REALLY LIKED IT
I5y0__X72p0_9	IT WAS GOOD
I5y0__X72p0_8	I DIDNT THINK IT WAS GREAT OR EPIC OR JUST FANTASTIC
I5y0__X72p0_39	WHICH IS COOL
I5y0__X72p0_38	THE MUSIC KINDA DROVE A LOT OF THE ACTION
I5y0__X72p0_11	IT WAS IT WAS AN IT WAS AN OKAY MOVIE
I5y0__X72p0_10	I MEAN I DONT REGRET SEEING IT
I5y0__X72p0_13	ANYWAYS SKIPPING PAST THAT SHES GOT THIS LIKE KICK A ATTITUDE
I5y0__X72p0_12	ERIC BANA DECIDES TO TRAIN TO BE THIS MOST PARANOID ASASSIN CHICK IN THE WORLD
I5y0__X72p0_15	ITS GOOD
I5y0__X72p0_14	SO ITS IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE A SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL TYPE OF MOVIE
I5y0__X72p0_17	ITS NOT POLISHED QUITE AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE
I5y0__X72p0_16	BUT ITS NOT GREAT
I5y0__X72p0_19	LIKE THEY CONVINCED ME LIKE THIS CHICK COULD PROBABLY TAKE THAT DUDE DOWN WHICH IS PRETTY HARD
I5y0__X72p0_18	IT IS GOOD THOUGH
I5y0__X72p0_31	IT WAS ORIGINAL
I5y0__X72p0_30	SO IT IT WAS AND INTERESTING MOVIE
I5y0__X72p0_37	I DID LIKE KIND OF LIKE THE ACTION
I5y0__X72p0_36	IT WASNT THE IT WASNT THE USUAL
I5y0__X72p0_35	BUT IT WAS IT WAS INTERESTING
I5y0__X72p0_34	UM IT WASNT BAD
I5y0__X72p0_33	THE SOUNDTRACK WAS INTERESTING
I5y0__X72p0_32	AND I LIKED IT
Iu2PFX3z_1s_11	THAT YOU RESPECT THAT JOE WRIGHT TRIED TO DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HERE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_10	BUT I THINK ITS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THATS SO UNIQUE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_13	ITS IN YOUR FACE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_12	ITS COLORFUL
Iu2PFX3z_1s_15	AND I THINK UM WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THIS WAS THAT REALLY TRIED VERY HARD TO MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL
Iu2PFX3z_1s_14	ITS REALLY NON STOP FROM BEGINNING TO END
Iu2PFX3z_1s_16	AND SOMETHING THAT I CANT FIND ANYTHING ELSE TO COMPARE IT TO
Iu2PFX3z_1s_1	THIS IS HIS MOST ENGAGING ENDEVOUR YET
Iu2PFX3z_1s_3	HE TAKES GREAT ACTORS OR ACRESSES IN THIS CASE LIKE SAOIRSE RONAN AND CATE BLANCHETT
Iu2PFX3z_1s_2	AND HE WHAT HE DOES WITH HANNA IS HE MAKES THE MOVIE ON LIKE ANYTHING WEVE SEEN BEFORE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_5	UM WHAT REALLY NEED ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THE CHAMICAL BROTHERS DID THE SOUNDTRACKS WHATS PULSE POUNDING THE ENTIRE WAY THROUGH
Iu2PFX3z_1s_4	AND HE PUTS THEM IN VERY STRANGE AND UNUSUAL CHARACTERS
Iu2PFX3z_1s_7	THERES ALL THESE COLORFUL CHARACTERS
Iu2PFX3z_1s_6	YOU NEVER KNOW WHATS GONNA HAPPEN
Iu2PFX3z_1s_9	I GAVE IT A B
Iu2PFX3z_1s_8	NOW IT ISNT A GREAT FANTASTIC TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT THAT KIND OF MOVIE

IumbAb8q2dM_1	I ALWAYS LIKE TO READ THE BOOK FIRST
IumbAb8q2dM_3	BECAUSE PRISCILLA FROM THE READABLES GAVE A SUCH A GOOD REVIEW
IumbAb8q2dM_2	ITS A WEIRD THING
IumbAb8q2dM_5	IT WAS SO GOOD
IumbAb8q2dM_4	UM I SUGGEST THAT YOU GUYS GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE
IumbAb8q2dM_7	UM USUALLY IM NOT REALLY A BIG HUGE SCIFI ALIEN KIND OF FAN
IumbAb8q2dM_6	UM ITS SURPASSED MY EXPECTATIONS
IumbAb8q2dM_9	UM I REALLY WANNA GO READ THE BOOK NOW
IumbAb8q2dM_8	BUT UM IT WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD
IumbAb8q2dM_11	I HEARD THAT IN THE BOOK IT DESCRIBES UM THE PLAN OF THE GLORY A LOT BETTER
IumbAb8q2dM_10	COZ IM SO CURIOUS TO SEE UM HOW THE STORYLINE UM GOT TO THAT POINT
IumbAb8q2dM_13	UM I CANT WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT TOO
IumbAb8q2dM_12	UM GIVES MORE DETAILS SO I CANT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT NOW
IumbAb8q2dM_15	UM HE WROTE A GOOD BOOK
IumbAb8q2dM_14	UM IT IT TURNS OUT THAT JAMES FRAY WHO UM I REALY LIKE
IumbAb8q2dM_17	IM REALLY EXCITED
IumbAb8q2dM_16	UM AND I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO COME OUT
IumbAb8q2dM_19	HE WAS UNBELIEVABLE
IumbAb8q2dM_18	UM AS FOR ALEX XXX I AM A NEW ALEX FAN
Jkswaaud0hk_11	BUT UM IT WAS IN A GOOD TASTE
Jkswaaud0hk_10	I WAS SURPRISED UM THE AMOUNT OF SKIN THEY SHOWED
Jkswaaud0hk_13	HE UM ADDED A GRAT DIMENSION TO THE MOVIE AS WELL
Jkswaaud0hk_12	UM AND I THOUGHT WOODY HARELSON WAS A FUNNY
Jkswaaud0hk_15	BUT OVERALL I THOUGHT IT WAS IT WAS A FUN PICTURE
Jkswaaud0hk_14	STORYLINE WAS OK
Jkswaaud0hk_17	UM CERTIANLY AGAIN MORE OF A DAY MOVIE THAN UM SEEING IT ALONE
Jkswaaud0hk_16	I I DO THINK ITS WORTH SEEING
Jkswaaud0hk_19	SO ID GO SEE IT
Jkswaaud0hk_18	UNLESS YOU LADIES GO TOGETHER TO SEE IT TOGETHER
Jkswaaud0hk_20	THUMBS UP
Jkswaaud0hk_1	MILA KUNIS AND JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE I THOUGHT THEY MADE A GREAT DUO
Jkswaaud0hk_3	THERES SOME GREAT BEDROOM SCENES
Jkswaaud0hk_2	MILA KUNIS SHE IS GORGEOUS
Jkswaaud0hk_5	A FINE LIGHT WEIGHT DAY MOVIE
Jkswaaud0hk_4	YOU GUYS ARE YOURE GONNA GET TO ENJOY
Jkswaaud0hk_7	UM CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME SCENES WHERE I THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE GONNA FEEL MORE THE EMOTION OF IT
Jkswaaud0hk_6	I THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE GOING TO ENJOY THIS MORE THAN THE GUYS
Jkswaaud0hk_9	GREAT STEAMY BEDROOM SCENES
Jkswaaud0hk_8	THERE ARE SOME FUNNY LINES
LSi-o-IrDMs_24	I WOULD LOVE THAT
LSi-o-IrDMs_25	THAT BE THAT WOULD BE COOL TO SEE I MEAN
LSi-o-IrDMs_26	EVENTUALLY WERE GONNA GET BURNED OUT AS A SOCI AS A SOCIETY
LSi-o-IrDMs_27	ONCE AGIAN WERE GONNA BE BURNED OUT ON 3D
LSi-o-IrDMs_20	COZ SOMETIMES 3D CAN MESS UP THE COLOR AT LEAST THE OLD ANAGLYPHIC 3D I THINK REAL D IT YOU KNOW HAD SORT OF HAD SORT OF TEMPTED BUT IT WINDS ITSELF ITS ALSO UM NOT IDEAL FOR FOR THE IMIGAE ITSLEF
LSi-o-IrDMs_21	UM BUT THIS LOOKED AMAZING LOOKED REALLY GOOD
LSi-o-IrDMs_22	AND IT MAKES IT WORTH GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOUVE GOT UM THE DOLBY 3D SOMEWHERE IN YOUR TOWN
LSi-o-IrDMs_23	AND I HOPE THIS TAKES OVER AS THE NEW SYSTEM
LSi-o-IrDMs_28	BECAUSE ITS IT IS A GIMMICK ULTMATELLY
LSi-o-IrDMs_29	UM BUT I WILL SAY UM WITH THIS WITH THIS QUALITY OF 3D YOU COULD ALMOST MAKE YOU KNOW A REGULAR LIKE A DRAMATIC MOVIE OR AN ACTION MOVIE OR SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY GOOD MOVIE AND YOU COULD MAKE IT 3D AND IT WOULDNT AT ALL
LSi-o-IrDMs_1	BUT ITS ACTUALLY WORTH TALKING ABOUT
LSi-o-IrDMs_3	AND I ACTUALLY AM NOT FINDING THE SERIES TO BE VERY FUN AND POPCORN KIND OF MOVIE
LSi-o-IrDMs_2	BECAUSE THE MOVIE ITSELF IS THE SAME OLD CRAP FROM THE SERIES
LSi-o-IrDMs_5	IN THIS CASE IT DIDNT TAKE MUCH CONVINCING WHICH IS A LITTLE SILLY
LSi-o-IrDMs_4	YOU JUST CANT WALK IN EXOPECTING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT
LSi-o-IrDMs_7	THE PLOT IS YOU KNOW
LSi-o-IrDMs_6	BUT THE ACTING IS BAD
LSi-o-IrDMs_9	I GUESS FOR THIS KIND OF MOVIE THE PLOT IS IS IS THREADBARE
LSi-o-IrDMs_8	ACTUALLY THE ACTING IS OK
LSi-o-IrDMs_11	BUT NONE OF THOSE THINGS MATTER ITS A FUN MOVIE ANYWAY
LSi-o-IrDMs_10	THE THE UM CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IS NIL
LSi-o-IrDMs_13	WHICH IS A TERRIBLE PICTURE
LSi-o-IrDMs_12	ITS A POPCORN MOVIE
LSi-o-IrDMs_15	I HAD IDEAL SEATS
LSi-o-IrDMs_14	UM BUT UM THIS 3D DEFINATELLY LOOKS A LOT BETTER I THINK THAT REAL D
LSi-o-IrDMs_17	UM BUT THE THEY LOOKED AWESOME
LSi-o-IrDMs_16	BECAUSE ITS GOOD TO SIT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THEATER WITH 3D
LSi-o-IrDMs_19	UM THE COLOR LOOKED GREAT
LSi-o-IrDMs_18	THE 3D ITSELF REALLY HAD IMPROVED
MLal-t_vJPM_11	NUMBER ONE IM GETTING A LITTLE SICK OF THE XXX KIND OF LEAD CHARACTER SORT OF REALLY AWKWARD BOY WHO IS REALLY AWKWARD AND STUFF YOU KNOW IM GETTING SICK OF THAT CHARACTER AND IM TIRED OF IT
MLal-t_vJPM_10	I HAVE TWO PROBLEMS WITH IT
MLal-t_vJPM_13	BUT HE MIGHT AS WELL
MLal-t_vJPM_12	AND I GET ANGRY ABOUT IT LAUGHTER XXX DOESNT PLAY BEST CHARACTER IN THE FILM
MLal-t_vJPM_15	SECOND THERES ONE MASSIVE PLOT HOLE IN THIS FILM AND IT IS THE SIZE OF A DRAGON THAT IS BIG AS A MOUNTAIN AND WHEN YOU SEE THE FILM YOULL PROBABLY KNOW WHAT I MEAN
MLal-t_vJPM_14	SO IM IM IM THROUGH WITH THAT GUY
MLal-t_vJPM_17	AND THE ONLY EXPLANATION I COME UP WITH MAKES THIS STORY KIND OF KIND OF CREEPY
MLal-t_vJPM_16	UM THERES NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS THING
MLal-t_vJPM_18	OTHER THEN THOSE TWO THINGS THIS IS A REALLY FUN FILM THAT YOU WILL ENJOY UNLESS YOU ARE SOLELESS PIECE OF MACHENERY
MLal-t_vJPM_1	I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT 3D IS REALLY RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE
MLal-t_vJPM_3	YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR KIDS
MLal-t_vJPM_2	YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON
MLal-t_vJPM_5	ITS PROBABLY THE BEST THING CURRENTLY IN THEATERS
MLal-t_vJPM_4	AND IF YOU DONT HAVE KIDS YOU MAY WANNA CONSIDER SEEING IT ANYWAY
MLal-t_vJPM_7	ITS A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH
MLal-t_vJPM_6	IT IS ITS A GREAT STORY
MLal-t_vJPM_9	AND ITS REALLY WELL WRITTEN
MLal-t_vJPM_8	ITS BEAUTIFULLY DONE
Njd1F0vZSm4_11	THEY REALLY NEEDED TO SOMEHOW SET THEM APART WITH ARMOR
Njd1F0vZSm4_10	YOU CANT TELL WHICH ARE THE GOOD OWLS WHICH ARE THE BED OWLS
Njd1F0vZSm4_13	OR YOU CAN SEE UP TO YOU
Njd1F0vZSm4_12	ANYWAY THIS IS ONE YOU CAN SKIP
Njd1F0vZSm4_1	IM GONNA GIVE THIS A GRADE B MINUS
Njd1F0vZSm4_3	THE FLYING SEQUENCES ARE BEAUTIFUL
Njd1F0vZSm4_2	THE CGI WORK THE 3D IS SPECTACULAR
Njd1F0vZSm4_5	AND COME OF REAL
Njd1F0vZSm4_4	AND THE OWLS ARE REALLY WONDERFUL
Njd1F0vZSm4_7	BUT THE STORY IS VERY DARK
Njd1F0vZSm4_6	AND THEY DO HAVE VERY NICE PERSONALITES
Njd1F0vZSm4_9	UM MY OTHER COMPLAINT OTHER THAN THAT THERES LIKE NOTHING LIGHT OR FUNNY IN THIS STORY TO BREAK UP THE SLUMBER MOOD IS THE BATTLE ITSELF
Njd1F0vZSm4_8	IN FACT MY SIX YEARS OLD WAS SCARED MOST OF THE MOVIE
Nzq88NnDkEk_24	UM BUT HEY IF YOURE LOOKING TO SPEND SOME MONEY UM GO CHECK IT OUT MAYBE YOU WILL LIKE IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_25	BUT UM FROM MY REVIEW IM GONNA SAY IM GONNA GIVE IT TWO THUMBS DOWN
Nzq88NnDkEk_26	RELEASE THE CRACKEN ON THIS MOVIE DONT GO SEE IT GO SEE SOMETHING ELSE HOW TO TRAIN THE DRAGON AND UM THATS ALL IM GONNA SAY ABOUT THAT
Nzq88NnDkEk_27	SO DISAPPOINTMENT DEFINATELY
Nzq88NnDkEk_20	AND MY FRIEDNS WHO WERE THERE HAD NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_21	SO UNFORTUNATELLY I MUST SAY THIS ONE IS PROBABLY GONNA BE WAITING UNTIL IT COMES ON HBO
Nzq88NnDkEk_22	OR GET IT AT UM UM RED BOX FOR A BUCK
Nzq88NnDkEk_23	UM I JUST REALLY DIDNT LIKE IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_28	I DID NOT WANNA GIVE THIS MOVIE A BAD REVIEW
Nzq88NnDkEk_29	I IM A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL YOU KNOW LOVED IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_1	WHICH IS A REBOOT I GUESS IT WOULD BE THE BEST TERM FOR THE I BELIEVE IT WAS A 1981 MOVIE CLASH OF THE TITANS
Nzq88NnDkEk_3	UM I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_2	UM UNFORTUNATELLY IM GOING TO HAVE TO SAY THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE
Nzq88NnDkEk_5	IS IT GONNA BE GOOD
Nzq88NnDkEk_4	I WAS A LITTLE HASITANT AT FIRSTYOU KNOW AS YOU ARE WITH WITH REBOOTS YOU KNOW
Nzq88NnDkEk_7	I THINK THAT MUSIC THAT MUSIC THEY KIND OF PULL IT WITH THE SOUNDTRACK REALLY GOT ME EXCITED ABOUT SEEING THIS MOVIE
Nzq88NnDkEk_6	BUT AS THE TRAILERS CAME OUT I I REALLY LIKED WHAT I WAS SEEING
Nzq88NnDkEk_9	BUT TO ME SOMEONE NEEDS TO RELEASE THE CRACKON ON THIS MOVIE AND JUST TOTALLY DESTROY IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_8	AND AND BEING A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL I WAS I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_11	IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS NO STORY DEVELOPMENT IN IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_10	BECAUSE I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A RUSHED MOVIE
Nzq88NnDkEk_13	I FELT LIKE MEDUSA REALLY WASNT THAT SCARY
Nzq88NnDkEk_12	UM I JUST REALLY DIDNT HAVE GOOD TIME
Nzq88NnDkEk_15	UM I JUST THINK THEY MADE HER ALMOST LOOKED TOO YOU KNOW THEY TRIED THAT YOU KNOW MAKE HER LOOK TOO BEAUTIFUL
Nzq88NnDkEk_14	MAYBE IT WAS COZ I WAS A KID BACK AT THAT DAY BUT MEDUSA WAS A LOT SCAR SCARIER THEN
Nzq88NnDkEk_17	THE SCREEN YOU KNOW WAS THAT I I KIND OF FO FOUND MYSELF YOU KNOW WANTED TO LAY MY HEAD BACK AND TAKE A NAP
Nzq88NnDkEk_16	BUT UM I JUST IN WHOLE REALLY DIDNT LIKE THIS MOVIE
Nzq88NnDkEk_19	AND AND AFTER THE MOVIE UM GOING OUT INTO THE THEATER INTO THE LOBBY I HAD NOONE I HEARD NOONE SAY ANYTHING GOOD
Nzq88NnDkEk_18	AND ACTUALLY THE GUY SITTING NEXT TO ME ACTUALLY WAS TAKING A NAP LAUGHTER HE KEPT DOZING OFF
Nzq88NnDkEk_31	HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE SCREENINGS ON THAT
Nzq88NnDkEk_30	AND UM BUT I GOT TO I GOT TO DO MY DUTY AND LET YOU GUYS KNOW ITS A A MAJOR SUCK FEST
Nzq88NnDkEk_32	AND UM LOOKING REALLY FORWARD TO SEEING THAT MOVIE
OQvJTdtJ2H4_11	SO THATS THUMBS DOWN IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND
OQvJTdtJ2H4_10	I GIVE IT ABOUT ONE AND A HALF STARS
OQvJTdtJ2H4_13	BUT THE CGI WAS GREAT
OQvJTdtJ2H4_12	SO IT IS NOT A BUY
OQvJTdtJ2H4_15	UM MEDUSA WAS WAY DIFFERENT FROM PERCY JACKSON AND GLANDON LAWS
OQvJTdtJ2H4_14	AND THATS EXECTLY HOW I THOUGHT A GIANT SCORPION WOULD LOOK WITH THE PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD THAT HAD BLUE FIRE ON IT
OQvJTdtJ2H4_16	BUT THE BEST PART ABOUT THE MOVIE I VE GOT A FREE PAIR OF GLASSES
OQvJTdtJ2H4_1	IT COULDVE BEEN BETTER
OQvJTdtJ2H4_3	THEY COULDVE MADE ZEUS A LITTLE LESS SPARKLY IT WAS VERY DISTRACTING
OQvJTdtJ2H4_2	THE FIRST ONE WAS A LOT BETTER
OQvJTdtJ2H4_5	THE FIRST ONE MADE MORE SENSE
OQvJTdtJ2H4_4	UM IT WAS VERY HARD TO FOLLOW
OQvJTdtJ2H4_7	THEY PRETEND THERES GONNA BE THIS BIG SCENE IT MAYBE LASTS ABOUT A MINUTE AND I WAS LIKE IS THAT IT
OQvJTdtJ2H4_6	AND THE CRACKON YOU KNOW IN THE PREVIEW IS LIKE SO MUCH HYPE
OQvJTdtJ2H4_9	THE PREVIEWS ARE MUCH MORE 3D THE NE SO YEAH IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING
OQvJTdtJ2H4_8	AND THAN ITS DEFINATELLY NOT A 3D MOVIE
OtBXNcAL_lE_24	I JUST GET SO TIRED OF UNPREDICTABLE MOVIES
OtBXNcAL_lE_20	UM YEA SO ANYWAYS ITS REALLY PREDICTABLE
OtBXNcAL_lE_21	I MEAN YOU CAN GO SEE I PERSONALLY DIDNT LIKE IT
OtBXNcAL_lE_22	BECAUSE I JUST GOT REALLY BORED WITH IT
OtBXNcAL_lE_23	UM AND ITS REALLY UNPREDICTABLE
OtBXNcAL_lE_1	AND A GUY WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE TOM CRUISE
OtBXNcAL_lE_3	UH I PERSONALLY THINK ITS A WASTE OF MONEY
OtBXNcAL_lE_2	UM LIP SMACKING THIS MOVIE IS DUMB
OtBXNcAL_lE_5	LAUGHING I JUST JUST CANT STAND MOVIES WHERE ITS LIKE THE SAME PLOT AS LIKE 50 OTHER MILLION MOVIES
OtBXNcAL_lE_4	JUST BECAUSE I CANT STAND MOVIES THAT ARE SO PREDICTABLE
OtBXNcAL_lE_7	I REALLY DONT CARE TO SEE THOSE
OtBXNcAL_lE_6	JUST DIFFERENT JUST DIFFERENT PEOPLE PLAYING THE ROLES
OtBXNcAL_lE_9	YOU KNOW I LIKE KATE HUDSON
OtBXNcAL_lE_8	BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I TOOK A CHANCE
OtBXNcAL_lE_11	AND DONT GET ME WRONG THERE WERE YOU KNOW FUNNY PARTS IN THE MOVIE
OtBXNcAL_lE_10	SO I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WOULD BE FUNNY
OtBXNcAL_lE_13	I DONT CARE FOR BASICALLY ANY OF IT
OtBXNcAL_lE_12	I JUST DONT CARE FOR THE PLOT
OtBXNcAL_lE_15	ITS THE SAME YOU KNOW RISE AND FALL
OtBXNcAL_lE_14	BECAUSE ITS PREDICTABLE
OtBXNcAL_lE_17	AND SO SHES ALL SAD WALKING IN THE RAIN BLAH BLAH BLAH
OtBXNcAL_lE_16	BUT SHES IN TROUBLE YOU KNOW CUZ SHE DOESNT WANNA TELL HER BEST FRIEND BLAH BLAH BLAH
OtBXNcAL_lE_19	IVE BEEN SAYING THAT A LOT IN THIS VIDEO BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
OtBXNcAL_lE_18	AND BLAH BLAH BLAH
Oz06ZWiO20M_24	ITS REALLY LIKE LIKE IF YOU WENT TO GO SEE THE BALLET AND ITS ABOUT THE SPECTACLES
Oz06ZWiO20M_25	LIKE THE STORY OF SWAN LAKE IS WHY PEOPLE GO SEE SWAN LAKE ITS THE MOVEMENT AND THE DANCING AND THE MUSIC AND THE SETS AND THE EXPERIENCE
Oz06ZWiO20M_20	AND THEN YOU KNOW PUT IN SOME ACTION OR SOME ROMANCE OR SEX OR WHATEVER LIKE TO KEEP PEOPLE SORT OF ENGAGED
Oz06ZWiO20M_21	UM AND THATS WHAT TRADITIONL NARRATIVE MOVIES DO
Oz06ZWiO20M_22	AND THIS MOVIE IS REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE THE PLOT IS WHAT LITTLE THERE IS
Oz06ZWiO20M_23	AND THE CHARACTERS ARE THEY ARE ALL JUST PLACE HOLDERS
Oz06ZWiO20M_1	THAT WAS PRETTY FUNNY AND UM STUPID FOR MOVIES HAD THIS REALLY LONG LIKE REALLY NOT REALLY LONG BUT LIKE REALLY INTENSE RENT A ABOUT IT
Oz06ZWiO20M_3	I DONT THINK ITS LIKE THE WORST MOVIE IVE EVEN SEEN JUST THIS YEAR
Oz06ZWiO20M_2	UM AND IT IT IS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY SAYING IT IS BAD
Oz06ZWiO20M_5	LIKE I WAS MORE ENTERTAINED BY IT THAN BATTLE LA WHICH WAS JUST A SLOG AND BORING AND I JUST TRY TO TOTALLY UNINTERESTING
Oz06ZWiO20M_4	BUT I WOULD SAY I I ENJOYED SUCKER PUNCH
Oz06ZWiO20M_7	UM IT IS BAD
Oz06ZWiO20M_6	AND SUCKER PUNCH IS A FAILER BUT LIKE A REALLY AMBITIOUS WEIRD THE INTERESTING IDIOSYNCRATIC FAILURE
Oz06ZWiO20M_9	ITS NOT BAD IN THE WAY I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE BAD
Oz06ZWiO20M_8	BUT ITS NOT BAD I THINK THE WAY MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING ITS BAD
Oz06ZWiO20M_11	LIKE I THINK MOST PEOPLE THATS THEIR KNOCK ON IT IS THAT ITS NOT YOU KNOW CONVENTIONALLY SATISFYING AS LIKE YOU KNOW WITH DRAMA THAT WE DONT GET TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE CHARACTERS THEIR PLAY ISNT INTERESTING THEIR PATH TO FREEDOM IS NOT COMPELLING AND ITS BASICALLY TELESCOPED WITHIN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WHERE WERE SORT OF TOLD WHATS GONNA HAPPEN BEFORE IT HAPPENS
Oz06ZWiO20M_10	UM IT REALLY IS NOT TRYING TO BE A DRAMATIC FILM OR AN ACTION FILM
Oz06ZWiO20M_13	I THINK ITS REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE A MUSICAL
Oz06ZWiO20M_12	UM AND AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE BUT I DONT THINK ITS TRYING TO BE THAT
Oz06ZWiO20M_15	BUT IT REALLY HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH A MUSICAL OR AND OPERA OR EVEN A BALLET THAN A REGULAR NARRATIVE FILM
Oz06ZWiO20M_14	AND I KNOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND SILLY COZ ITS SUCH A BROAD GOOFY MAINSTREAM CULT KIND OF MOVIE
Oz06ZWiO20M_17	SO ITS LIKE PUTS SOME PEOPLE IN IT AND YOURE GONNA ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH THEM
Oz06ZWiO20M_16	COZ LIKE AM REMAINS IN NARRATIVE FILM IS ABOUT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND PLOT AND THEN SPECTACLE LIKE IN THIRD PLACE
Oz06ZWiO20M_19	MAKE THEM COMPELLING IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS COMPELLING AND THEN HAVE A STORY THATS LIKE AT FIVE MINUTES THIS HAPPENS AND AT TEN MINUTES THIS HAPPENS THAT LIKE MOVES FORWARD AND HAS MOMENTUM
Oz06ZWiO20M_18	THERERE SOME FUNNY DIALOGUE
POKffnXeBds_11	I MEAN THAT MOVIE WAS A WASTE OF TIME
POKffnXeBds_10	I MEAN HER ACTING IS LIKE SO SO AND I CANT BELIEVE SHE EVEN WON A OSCAR BELEIVE SHE WON AN OSCAR OR FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS OR BEST ACTRESS SOMETHING
POKffnXeBds_13	AND IT JUST REALLY WASNT GOOD
POKffnXeBds_12	ITS TWO GIRLS TRYING TOO HARD
POKffnXeBds_1	WHAT CAN I SAY IM JUST CURIOUS
POKffnXeBds_3	YES SHE HAS A FAT ASS IN TERMS OF WHITE GIRLS BUT HER ASS ISNT REALLY THAT FAT
POKffnXeBds_2	DONT GET ME WRONG KATE HUDSON IS IS PRETTY FINE LOOKING BUT I JUST THINK ITS KIND OF STUPID EVERYONE SAYS HAS A FAT ASS
POKffnXeBds_5	I MEAN THE MOVIE REALLY WASNT FUNNY AT ALL
POKffnXeBds_4	FIRST OF ALL THE MOVIE WAS BORING
POKffnXeBds_7	I MEAN THE MOVIE WAS I GUESS IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME
POKffnXeBds_6	ALL THE ALL THE FUNNY PARTS WERENT FUNNY
POKffnXeBds_9	ANNE HATHAWAY IS REALLY OVER RATED IN MY OPINION
POKffnXeBds_8	I WA HEY SHE MIGHT LIKE IT BUT EVEN THEN ITS NOT REALLY FUNNY AT ALL
PZ-lDQFboO8_11	I LIKED ANTS
PZ-lDQFboO8_10	I LOVE THE SHREK FILMS
PZ-lDQFboO8_12	BUT AS FAR AS KUNG FU PANDA GOES I WAS HOPING FOR A LOT MORE IT JUST WASNT THERE FOR ME I DONT KNOW
PZ-lDQFboO8_1	I WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THE FILM
PZ-lDQFboO8_3	IT DIDNT HAVE A WHOLE OUT OF HUMOR GOING ON WITH IT AT LEAST NONE THAT REALLY MADE YOU WANNA LAUGH OUT LOUD
PZ-lDQFboO8_2	BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS JUST A LITTLE DRY
PZ-lDQFboO8_5	NOW IM NOT GONNA LIE THERERE A FEW PARTS THAT HAVE GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES NOW EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN ANIMATED FILM IT DID HAVE SOME GREAT FIGHT SCENES
PZ-lDQFboO8_4	UM EVEN THE KIDS AND THE AUDIENCE ITSELF JUST KIND OF CHUCKLED A LITTLE BIT GAVE A FEW LAUGHS
PZ-lDQFboO8_7	EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THE TRAILER ITSELF WAS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE HUMOR YOURE GONNA SEE IN THE MOVIE
PZ-lDQFboO8_6	UM BUT AS FAR AS HUMOR GOES NOT AS MUCH AS I WAS EXPECTING
PZ-lDQFboO8_9	UM MAYBE BETTER LIKE NEXT TIME DREAMWORKS BUT FOR THIS ONE FOR ME IT JUST WASNT WHAT I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE
PZ-lDQFboO8_8	UM UM A YOU KNOW ALONG WITH THE XXX I WOULD PROBABLY SAYING GO SEE THIS MOVIE AN EARLY SHOWING DONT SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE NIGHT VIEWING
QN9ZIUWUXsY_11	UM THE DIRECTION IS A BIT ITS WOBBLY
QN9ZIUWUXsY_10	ITS ITS A BIT OF A MIXED BAG COZ THERE WERE SOME VERY BRIGHT MOMENTS
QN9ZIUWUXsY_13	BUT WHAT IT LACKS IN THOSE AREAS IT MOST DEFINATELY MAKES UP FOR JUST LIKE SHEER VISUAL SPECTACLE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_12	BASICALLY A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT I COULD TAKE A MOVIE ON ITS REALLY WOBBLY
QN9ZIUWUXsY_15	SO MANY MOMENTS IN THIS MOVIE THAT ARE JUST FRAMED AND LIT SO PERFECTLY THAT SO THAT YOU JUST GO LIKE KIND OF HUH THATS REALLY REALLY COOL
QN9ZIUWUXsY_14	I MEAN THIS MOVIE HAS THE MOST GORGEOUS VISUALS OUT OF ANY MOVIES SINCE PROBABLY AVATAR ME IF NOT PRETTIER
QN9ZIUWUXsY_17	IT IT DOESNT MAKE MUCH SENSE I KNOW
QN9ZIUWUXsY_16	AND THEN TAKE THAT WORLD THAT HAVE BEEN SET LIKE A CRAP TUNNEL OF REALLY KINETIC REALLY WELL DONE ACTION SEQUENCES IN IT AND YOU HAVE TRON LEGACY
QN9ZIUWUXsY_18	AND BASICALLY THIS MAKES NO SENSE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_1	MAIN DRAW FOR ME FOR THIS MOVIE WAS JUST THE FACT THAT ITS SET IN THIS LIKE RIDICULOUS WORLD WITH ALL THESE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND RIDICULOUS ACTION SEQUENCES
QN9ZIUWUXsY_3	BUT I DO THINK ITS A VERY INTERESTING ONE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_2	AND I DONT THINK THATS A VERY GOOD MOVIE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_5	BUT I WAS STILL RIDICILOUSLY ENTERTAINED BY IT
QN9ZIUWUXsY_4	I CAN TELL YOU THAT TRON LEGACY IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_7	TRON LEGACY IS A MOVIE WHERE ON MOST COUNTS THAT I JUDGE MOVIES IT KIND OF FAILS
QN9ZIUWUXsY_6	ARE THESE TWO THINGS POSSIBLE IN THE SAME SENTANCEI I REALLY DO THINK SO
QN9ZIUWUXsY_9	THE SCRIPT CAN BE HORRIBLE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_8	THE PERFORMANCES ARE NAH
Qr1Ca94K55A_11	AND SOME REALLY COOL GUN FIGHTS
Qr1Ca94K55A_10	UM ONE OF THE BIG THINGS I WAS DISAPPOINTED THOUGH WAS I FELT THAT THEY COULDVE DONE A LOT MORE WITH 3D
Qr1Ca94K55A_13	UM NOW I DONT REALLY RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU GO ON A DATE WITH SOME GIRL
Qr1Ca94K55A_12	AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GONNA BE MORE THAN THAT BUT SO I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THAT
Qr1Ca94K55A_14	UM BUT IF YOURE XXX MOVIE GOER LIKE I AM I TOTALLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS BECAUSE ITS JUST A FUN ENTERTAINING MOVIE AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL ENJOYE IT
Qr1Ca94K55A_1	NOW THIS MOVIE IS JUST RIDICULOUS AND I I THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT
Qr1Ca94K55A_3	SHE DIDNT REALLY DO ANYTHING FOR ME
Qr1Ca94K55A_2	HER ACTING WAS PRETTY BAD
Qr1Ca94K55A_5	AND HIS ACTING WASNT REALLY GOOD IN THAT MOVIE
Qr1Ca94K55A_4	BUT THE REAL STAR THAT FELL OUT OF THIS MOVIE WAS WILLIAM FICHTNER CHARACTER OR WILLIAM FICHTNER
Qr1Ca94K55A_7	AND WHATEVER SO NO IM NOT SAYING THIS MOVIE IS BAD COZ ITS ITS NOT
Qr1Ca94K55A_6	BUT IT MADE IT HYSTERICAL AND IT WAS JUST FUNNY WITH ALL OF THESE LITTLE ONE LINERS THAT HE HAD
Qr1Ca94K55A_9	IT WAS IT WAS GOOD
Qr1Ca94K55A_8	LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT HAD TACKY ONE LINERS THAT WERE JUST HYSTERICAL
Sqr0AcuoNnk_20	THE WHOLE TIME I SAW HER ALL I THOUGHT WAS HELEN HUNT AND RENEE ZELLWEGGER
Sqr0AcuoNnk_21	ANOTHER THING WAS THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP OR POSITIVE GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN THIS WHOLE MOVIE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_22	BUT THATS KIND OF DEPRESSING
Sqr0AcuoNnk_1	I DONT REALLY KNOW I DONT ITS SO WEIRD
Sqr0AcuoNnk_3	AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
Sqr0AcuoNnk_2	I THERE WERE TIMES IN THE MOVIE WHERE I FELT REALLY BORED
Sqr0AcuoNnk_5	I JUST DONT THINK IT WAS VERY GOOD
Sqr0AcuoNnk_4	AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I WAS JUST SITTING THERE AFTER THEY SAID THEIR JOKES AND I WAS LIKE THATS NOT NOBODYS LAUGHING THATS NOT FUNNY
Sqr0AcuoNnk_7	SO I THINK THAT NO STRINGS ATTACHED WAS BETTER THAN FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS
Sqr0AcuoNnk_6	AND THIS IS THE THING FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS AND NO STRINGS ATTACHED THEY ARE THE SAME MOVIE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING TO THE SAME POINT BUT ITS THE SAME POINT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_9	I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FUNNY
Sqr0AcuoNnk_8	I WAS NOT BORED DURING NO STRINGS ATTACHED
Sqr0AcuoNnk_11	BUTSIGH IT HAD A LOT OF REALLY BAD MOMENTS
Sqr0AcuoNnk_10	UM AND UH FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS HAD ITS MOMENTS
Sqr0AcuoNnk_13	HE IS BRILLIANT THERE IS NOT A MOVIE THAT I SEE HIM IN THAT I DONT END UP CRYING BECAUSE HE IS SO FANTASTIC AND HE JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART WHENEVER HE DOES YOU KNOW A ROLE THAT USUALLY HIS ROLES DO BREAK YOUR HEART AT SOME POINT SO DEFINITELY DID IN THIS MOVIE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_12	AND HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS EVER
Sqr0AcuoNnk_15	THE LADY WHO PLAYS JUSTIN TIMBERLAKES SISTER UM I THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN THIS MOVIE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_14	I LIKE TEARED UP IN FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS BECAUSE OF HIM
Sqr0AcuoNnk_17	AND SHE LOOKS LIKE RENEE ZELLWEGGER AND HELEN HUNT FROM A TWISTER MOVIE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_16	AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST LIKE REALLY NATURAL AND FUNNY
Sqr0AcuoNnk_19	IT WAS WEIRD
Sqr0AcuoNnk_18	AND SHE TALKS LIKE HER TOO
TvyZBvOMOTc_11	LIP SMAKCING A LOT OF THIS MOVIE BRINGS A CUTE LAUGH HERE AND THERE
TvyZBvOMOTc_10	EVEN THOUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE IS BASED ON WHETHER SHE GETS TO DUBLIN IN TIME YOURE NEVER REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE GETS THERE
TvyZBvOMOTc_13	AND SEEM TO BE REALLY ENJOYING THEMSELVES THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH
TvyZBvOMOTc_12	AND BOTH THE ACTORS AMY ADAMS AND MATTHEW GOODE WORK WELL WITH EACH OTHER
TvyZBvOMOTc_15	ALL IN ALL IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A CUTE ROMANTIC COMEDY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SETTING THEN THIS WILL PROBABLY BE A GOOD MOVIE FOR YOU
TvyZBvOMOTc_14	EVEN WHEN THEYRE FIGHTING IN THE MOVIE THOUGH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ITS THEIR BANTER NOT ACTUAL DISLIKE
TvyZBvOMOTc_1	WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER NAME FOR THE MOVIE
TvyZBvOMOTc_3	THE COUNTRYSIDE WHICH THEY SHOWED WHILE GOING ACROSS IRELAND WAS ASTOUNDINGLY BLE BEAUTIFUL
TvyZBvOMOTc_2	AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT
TvyZBvOMOTc_5	ALTHOUGH I ENJOYED THE MOVIE
TvyZBvOMOTc_4	AND IN THE SCENE WITH THE DESTROYED CASTLE IT REALLY REMINDED ME WHY I WANT TO GO THERE SO BADLY
TvyZBvOMOTc_7	ITS A FUN CHICK FLICK
TvyZBvOMOTc_6	IF I THINK ABOUT IT HONESTLY THE PLOT WASNT THAT GREAT
TvyZBvOMOTc_9	LIP SMACKING ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT COME TO STOP THEM FROM GETTING TO THEIR DESTINATION ARE ALTHOUGH PLAUSIBLE A LITTLE WEAK
TvyZBvOMOTc_8	BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT DOESNT REALLY HOLD UP UNDER INSPECTION
VCslbP0mgZI_11	SO ZACH SNYDER HERE IS MAKING A MOVIE THATS OSTENSIBLY ABOUT FEMALE EMPOW EMPOWERMENT BUT ITS A MOVIE ABOUT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT WHICH INCLUDES A LOT OF CLEARING THROAT SLAPPING THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF WOMEN IN BUSTIERS THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF VIOLENCE DONE AGAINST WOMEN AND ULTIMATELY IN WHICH MOST OF THE WOMEN END UP COMPLETELY DISEMPOWERED
VCslbP0mgZI_10	IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE IN FACT IT WOULD BE RACIST
VCslbP0mgZI_13	I COULD KINDA SEE THAT IN A SORT OF CHRIS ROCK DAVE CHAPELLE WAY
VCslbP0mgZI_12	CLAPPING LAUGHING SO OKAY IF ZACH SNYDER WERE A WOMAN I WOULD SAY OKAY SHES MAKING A COMMENT ABOUT THE WAY WOMEN CANT BE EMPOWERED IN MALE DOMINATED SOCIETIES IN THE WAY MEN UM DISTRACT AND AND HURT AND DAMAGE WOMEN AND PREVENT THEM FROM ASSERTING WHO THEY REALLY ARE
VCslbP0mgZI_15	SO IF I GIVE ZACH SNYDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THIS IS A MOVIE THAT LOOKS GREAT HAS SOME BAD ACTING
VCslbP0mgZI_14	BUT ZACH SNYDER IS A GUY AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS STUFF KINDA ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE THE SH HE MAN WOMAN HATERS CLUB
VCslbP0mgZI_17	IF I DONT GIVE ZACH SNYDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
VCslbP0mgZI_16	AND HAS WAY TOO MUCH VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
VCslbP0mgZI_1	POOP
VCslbP0mgZI_3	GUARDIANS OF OWL LAND WHATEVER THAT CAME OUT AND I NEVER SAW IT
VCslbP0mgZI_2	MUSIC IN BACKGROUND LAUGHING CURRENTLY IN THEATRES STARRING NO ONE YOUVE EVER HEARD OF
VCslbP0mgZI_5	UM HERES WHY YES STUTTERING T THERES PROBLEMS WITH THIS AND I WANNA TALK ABOUT THEM BUT YOU KNOW IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
VCslbP0mgZI_4	AND THIS SUCKERS GETTING THIS SUCKER IS GETTING PANNED LIKE LAST AIRBENDER GARBAGE PANNED AND I WANNA SAY THIS I DID NOT THINK IT WAS LIKE LAST AIRBENDER GARBAGE
VCslbP0mgZI_7	IT ACTUALLY HAS SOME SOME THEM THEMATICALLY IT HAS SOME COOL THEMES ABOUT HEROISM AND ABOUT LIKE TAKING OWNERSHIP OF YOURSELF AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH I RESONATED WITH AND I WHI AND WHICH I APPRECIATED
VCslbP0mgZI_6	THERE ARE SOME REALLY COOL UH MOMENTS IN THIS
VCslbP0mgZI_9	UM IF LIKE ME OR LAUGHING SOME OTHER WHITE PERSON OR HISPANIC PERSON OR WHATEVER DID THE SAME JOKES IT WOULD NOT BE FUNNY
VCslbP0mgZI_8	BUT HERES THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE THE ESSENTAIL PROBLEM OF THIS MOVIE WELL MAYBE THIS WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT UM THERE WAS A UH A COMEDIAN NAMED DAVE CHAPELLE UM AND DAVE CHAPELLE UM AND ANOTHER COMEDIAN CHRIS ROCK ARE UM AFRICAN AMERICAN AND IN THEIR COMEDY THEY SOMETIMES TAKE ON AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE AND SO THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY MAKE FUN OF BLACK PEOPLE AND THE THING WITH DAVE CHAPELLE AND WITH CHRIS ROCK IS BECAUSE THEYRE BLACK THEY CAN KINDA DO THAT AND THERES SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THATS ACCEPTABLE
VbQk4H8hgr0_54	AND IT WASNT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION TO GO SEE IT
VbQk4H8hgr0_42	SO THAT JUST PISSED ME OFF MORE
VbQk4H8hgr0_48	AND I LOVED IT AND THIS ONE JUST WAS A FLAT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS
VbQk4H8hgr0_43	BUT REALLY I COULDVE SHOULDVE JUST WALKED UP AND LEFT AT THAT MOMENT
VbQk4H8hgr0_49	SO IM GONNA RATE THIS ONE TWO STARS
VbQk4H8hgr0_52	BECAUSE THE MOVIE DID HAVE SOME POINTS WHEN I WAS LAUGHING
VbQk4H8hgr0_53	BUT VERY FEW
VbQk4H8hgr0_24	UM IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME
VbQk4H8hgr0_25	AND I DONT SUGGEST ANYONE GO SEE IT
VbQk4H8hgr0_26	IF YOURE HOPING TO IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND YOURE FORCED TO GO WHICH YOU PROBABLY WILL IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU KNOW PUT UP WITH IT AS A PARENT
VbQk4H8hgr0_27	BUT ON YOUR OWN DONT GO SEE IT
VbQk4H8hgr0_20	IT COULDVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER I I COULDVE I SAW IT BEING SO MUCH BETTER IN MY HEAD BUT IT JUST WASNT
VbQk4H8hgr0_21	IT DISAPPOINTED ME HIGHLY
VbQk4H8hgr0_22	AND I WAS JUST SORT OF DISCOURAGED AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE
VbQk4H8hgr0_23	AND IM DEFINATELLY WISH I HAD MY MONEY BACK
VbQk4H8hgr0_46	IT COULDVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER
VbQk4H8hgr0_47	THAN THE SECOND SEQUEL WAS REALLY GREAT
VbQk4H8hgr0_44	IT WAS BORING
VbQk4H8hgr0_45	AND NOT AT ALL ORIGINAL IN MY OPINION
VbQk4H8hgr0_28	ITS NOT REALLY THAT GREAT
VbQk4H8hgr0_29	EVERYONE IS SPLIT ON THIS ONE JUST AS THEY WERE ON SPIDERMAN
VbQk4H8hgr0_40	AND THE CHARACTERS JUST WERENT THE SAME AS THE FIRST TWO THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM
VbQk4H8hgr0_41	IT JUST KIND OF MADE ME WANNA REALLY WALK OUT OF THE THEATER
VbQk4H8hgr0_1	AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT I CAN SAY WAS DEFINATELLY DISAPPOINTED
VbQk4H8hgr0_3	AND I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT THIS ONE BE JUST AS GOOD
VbQk4H8hgr0_2	I LOVE THE FIRST SHREK AND THE SECOND SHREK
VbQk4H8hgr0_5	I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT
VbQk4H8hgr0_4	AND IT JUST THAT IT HADNT ANYTHING NEW TO OFFER
VbQk4H8hgr0_7	AND IT OFFERED NOTHING OF THE SUCH
VbQk4H8hgr0_6	I MEAN I WENT IN THERE HOPING TO SEE SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND FUNNY LIKE THE FIRST TWO
VbQk4H8hgr0_9	THERE WAS A FEW JOKES OK YEAH MAKE YOU GIGGLE OR SOMETHING
VbQk4H8hgr0_8	IT WASNT REMOTLY FUNNY
VbQk4H8hgr0_51	BUT IM GONNA GIVE IT A TWO TO BE FAIR
VbQk4H8hgr0_39	BUT I STILL FIND IT POINTLESS IN THE END OF THE MOVIE
VbQk4H8hgr0_38	I MEAN ITS PLEASENT TO THE STORY
VbQk4H8hgr0_11	NOTHING REALLY THAT FUNNY
VbQk4H8hgr0_10	BUT THATS NOTHING MAJOR
VbQk4H8hgr0_13	THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL THE SAME
VbQk4H8hgr0_12	OR ANYTHING ORIGINAL
VbQk4H8hgr0_15	AND I LOVED PUSS IN BOOTS
VbQk4H8hgr0_14	AND NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES
VbQk4H8hgr0_17	THE DONKEY AND PUSS IN BOOTS RIVALRY THATS GOING ON IT JUST IT WASNT AS FUNNY THE THIRD TIME AROUND
VbQk4H8hgr0_16	AND HE WASNT EVEN THAT GREAT THIS TIME AROUND
VbQk4H8hgr0_19	PLAIN AND SIMPLY IT WAS DULL FOR ME
VbQk4H8hgr0_18	AND THERE WAS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER
VbQk4H8hgr0_31	I HAVE TO AGREE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WAS NOT GREAT
VbQk4H8hgr0_30	AND JUST THEY ARE WITH ALL THE OTHER SEQUELS THAT ARE COMING OUT AN THIS ONE
VbQk4H8hgr0_37	SO THE ADDITION OF THIS CHARACTER WAS PRETTY POINTLESS
VbQk4H8hgr0_36	AND NONE OF THEM WERE REALLY THAT GREAT I MEAN STANDS OUT IN YOUR MIND
VbQk4H8hgr0_35	BUT THEY DIDNT EVEN GIVE HIM THAT MUCH TO DO THE HE HAD ONLY FEW MINOR LINES
VbQk4H8hgr0_34	AND THERES A NE AN INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CHARACTER JUSTINE TIMBERLAKES CHARACTER ALREADY IN THE FILM
VbQk4H8hgr0_33	I MEAN THERES A FEW MOMENTS YEAH THAT ARE ORIGINAL AND FUNNY
VbQk4H8hgr0_55	SO I DEFINATELLY SUGGEST
VbQk4H8hgr0_32	IT WASNT EVEN REMOTELY GOOD
VbQk4H8hgr0_50	IT SHOULDVE REALLY BE ONE
Vj1wYRQjB-o_1	WELL HE PLAYS THAT WELL SO HES A GOOD VILLAIN
Vj1wYRQjB-o_3	ITS PRETTY PRETTY SCARY LOOKING
Vj1wYRQjB-o_2	HE ALSO HAS SOME REALLY COOL GUNS SO THAT ITS LIKE A DESERT EAGLE BUT IT HAS TO BARRELS TO IT
Vj1wYRQjB-o_5	AND I WHO WOULD I MEAN
Vj1wYRQjB-o_4	I WOULDNT WANT THAT POINTED AT ME
Vj1wYRQjB-o_7	THE ACTION THEY DO HAVE IS REALLY WELL DONE
Vj1wYRQjB-o_6	UM LIKE I SAID I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT
Vj1wYRQjB-o_9	THEY DID A GOOD JOB WITH THE FIGHT SCENES
Vj1wYRQjB-o_8	UM THEY DID A GOOD JOB WITH CAR
W8NXH0Djyww_24	UM BUT THIS MOVIE IT HAD EVERYTHING HUMOR ROMANCE ACTION
W8NXH0Djyww_25	OF COURSE UM IT WAS JUST IT WAS FUN IT WAS A FUN ENTERTAINING MOVIE
W8NXH0Djyww_26	UH IT WAS GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY
W8NXH0Djyww_27	UM DEFINITELY RECOMMEND CHECKING SEEING THIS UH CHECKING THIS MOVIE OUT
W8NXH0Djyww_20	IM NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THEY WERE
W8NXH0Djyww_21	IT WAS JUST SO COOL
W8NXH0Djyww_22	LIKE A COVERED WAGON HORSE KINDA COWBOY CHASE SEQUENCE
W8NXH0Djyww_23	OH IT WAS SO COOL
W8NXH0Djyww_28	UH I RATED IT FOUR OUT OF FIVE STARS
W8NXH0Djyww_29	UM THE ONE THING I DIDNT LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THEY BROUGHT THE MAIN CHARA UH THE BAD CHARACTER I SHOULD SAY IN KINDA LATE
W8NXH0Djyww_1	NOW RANGO WAS JUST FANTASTIC
W8NXH0Djyww_3	UH IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
W8NXH0Djyww_2	SURPRISED ME
W8NXH0Djyww_5	IT HAD ALL THIS STEREOTYPICAL TRAITS OF A WESTERN TOWN
W8NXH0Djyww_4	AND THIS TOWN WAS LIKE FROM A GOOD OLD WESTERN
W8NXH0Djyww_7	IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE
W8NXH0Djyww_6	I DUNNO BUT IT WAS IT WAS COOL
W8NXH0Djyww_9	THE ALL THE ANIMALS WERE JUST SO FUNNY
W8NXH0Djyww_8	AND NOW WHAT I LOVED ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS LIKE THE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE
W8NXH0Djyww_11	THEYRE LIKE THE DUMB KINDA COWBOYS THAT DONT KNOW WHAT THEYRE DOING ALWAYS ASKING DUMB QUESTIONS STAYING SAYING STUPID SHIT
W8NXH0Djyww_10	UM THEY ALL PLAYED OFF EACH OTHER
W8NXH0Djyww_13	AND THE STUFF HE SAID WAS JUST IT WAS JUST SO FUNNY
W8NXH0Djyww_12	AND IT WAS JUST OH IT WAS HYSTERICAL
W8NXH0Djyww_15	ALL THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IN THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT
W8NXH0Djyww_14	AND HE DID A WONDERFUL JOB
W8NXH0Djyww_17	UM LIKE THIS MOVIE HAD GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES
W8NXH0Djyww_16	LIKE ALL THE SUNSETS AND ALL THE LANDSCAPES OF THE FILMS THEY JUST LOOKED SO REALISTIC IN EVERY ALMOST EVERY SCENE
W8NXH0Djyww_19	OR NAH I WOULDNT SAY POSSUMS BUT PRAIRIE DOGS
W8NXH0Djyww_18	THIS AW THIS ONE REALLY COOL ACTION SEQUENCES WHERE LIKE THIS RONNY UH JOHNNY DEPPS POSSE THEY WERE GETTING CHASED BY ALL THESE LIKE POSSUMS
W8NXH0Djyww_31	UM EVERYTHING ELSE HELD UP ITS OWN
W8NXH0Djyww_30	BUT THAT DIDNT REALLY MATTER
W8NXH0Djyww_32	UM DEFINITELY CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE RANGO UH IN A THEATRE NEAR YOU
WKA5OygbEKI_20	I DEFINITELY WILL BUY IT
WKA5OygbEKI_21	BUT UH IT WAS WORTH THE FREE MOVIE PASSES THAT I USED ON IT
WKA5OygbEKI_22	AND THANKS FOR LISTENING TO ME RAMBLE
WKA5OygbEKI_1	UH I REALLY ENJOYED DOING THEM FOR THE PHILLY D MOVIE CLUB SO I THOUGHT OH WHY NOT
WKA5OygbEKI_3	UM I I LIKED A LOT OF THE MOVIE
WKA5OygbEKI_2	UH RANGO IS A REALLY CUTE MOVIE
WKA5OygbEKI_5	UM I PRETTY MUCH WILL GO SEE ANY MOVIE THAT KIND OF HAS AN INTERESTING PLOT IF HES IN IT
WKA5OygbEKI_4	I WILL ADMIT IM A BIG JOHNNY DEPP FAN
WKA5OygbEKI_7	I MEAN CORPSE BRIDE HES REALLY GOOD IN CORPSE BRIDE
WKA5OygbEKI_6	UM ITS NOT HIS BEST
WKA5OygbEKI_9	WELL ITS A JOHNNY DEPP MOVIE SO ITS ENTERTAINING
WKA5OygbEKI_8	AND RANGO KIND OF FALLS INTO THAT
WKA5OygbEKI_11	OR SOMETHING I WOULD RECOMMEND
WKA5OygbEKI_10	BUT ITS NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD GO BUY
WKA5OygbEKI_13	OH IT HAS SOME REALLY GOOD REFERENCES OF PAST JOHNNY DEPP FILMS IN IT LIKE WHILE THE CHAMELEONS GETTING BOUNCED ALONG THE HIGHWAY YOU RUN INTO HENRY S THOMPSON
WKA5OygbEKI_12	UNLESS YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS TO BRING WITH YOU
WKA5OygbEKI_15	I MEAN JOHNNY DEPPS A WONDERFUL VOICE ACTOR SO UM HE HES I DO HES AN INCREDIBLE VOICE ACTOR
WKA5OygbEKI_14	UH HES SUPER ENTERTAINING AS THE CHAMELEON
WKA5OygbEKI_17	AND BE THIS REALLY QUIRKY LITTLE CHAMELEON
WKA5OygbEKI_16	LIKE THATS REALLY THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE IS LISTENING TO HIM UH PULL OFF ALL THESE DIFFERENT VOICES
WKA5OygbEKI_19	BUT IF YOU DONT REALLY HAVE ANY SMALL FRIENDS UH THAT SOUNDED REALLY PERVERTED SMALL CHILDREN THAT YOU ARE RELATED TO UM TO TAKE TO THE MOVIES UH I WOULDNT GO SEE IT BY MYSELF
WKA5OygbEKI_18	UM I I WOULD YEAH I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS
X3j2zQgwYgE_11	OKAY AND NOW ITS LATE
X3j2zQgwYgE_10	CHUCKLE BE FOREWARNED LOW EXPECTATIONS
X3j2zQgwYgE_1	NOT GREAT
X3j2zQgwYgE_3	UM ITS JUST NOT THERE
X3j2zQgwYgE_2	SIGH I REALLY THINK WHAT THIS WAS MISSING WAS THAT HUMOR AND THAT WIT THAT THAN THE OTHER SHREK MOVIES
X3j2zQgwYgE_5	BUT ITS REALLY NOT WONDERFUL
X3j2zQgwYgE_4	ITS OKAY
X3j2zQgwYgE_7	THERE ARENT A LOT OF KIDS MOVIES OUT RIGHT NOW SO
X3j2zQgwYgE_6	NOTHING TO RUSH OUT AND SEE
X3j2zQgwYgE_9	BUT LACK YOU KNOW VERY LACKLUSTER
X3j2zQgwYgE_8	AND I GUESS NORMALLY SHREK IS FOR ADULTS
ZAIRrfG22O0_1	SAVE YOUR MONEY WAIT TIL IT COMES OUT ON RENTAL
ZAIRrfG22O0_3	THERE WERE A FEW FUNNY LINES
ZAIRrfG22O0_2	FOR ME IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME
ZAIRrfG22O0_5	THE MOVIE THEATRE GAVE ME CREDIT TO A FUTURE MOVIE SO THAT I APPRECIATE IT
ZAIRrfG22O0_4	BUT AFTER AN HOUR I JUST SAID ENOUGH I HAD TO WALK OUT
ZAIRrfG22O0_7	UH IF YOU DIDNT LIKE THAT TYPE OF MOVIE THEN I REALLY DONT THINK YOURE GONNA LIKE THIS AT ALL
ZAIRrfG22O0_6	UH IF YOU LIKE THE KIND OF MOVIE THAT BEN STILLER DID A NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM THEN YOU PROBABLY WOULD LIKE SOMETHING UH LIKE THIS
ZAIRrfG22O0_9	BUT UH THERES DEFINITELY FAR BETTER MOVIES THAT YOU CAN UH GO SEE THAN UM TONGUE CLICKING THAN ZOOKEEPER
ZAIRrfG22O0_8	AND YOURE BETTER OFF SAVING YOUR MONEY UH AND MAYBE RENTING IT WHEN IT COMES OUT ON UH VIDEO SO
ZUXBRvtny7o_24	THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS REALLY GREAT
ZUXBRvtny7o_25	I WILL EVEN PICK UP THIS MOVIE ON BLURAY
ZUXBRvtny7o_26	I WILL EVEN PICK UP THIS MOVIE ON BLURAY UM ANYWAYS UM THE MOVIE FOR ME IS THREE STARTS OUT OF FIVE STARS THREE SOLID STARS
ZUXBRvtny7o_27	CAUSE I HAD A GOOD TIME
ZUXBRvtny7o_20	UM THE ENDING IS OPEN FOR A SEQUEL
ZUXBRvtny7o_21	AND UH I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE A SEQUEL OF THIS MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_22	BECAUSE I REALLY DIG THIS MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_23	I REALLY DIG THIS MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_28	AND UH THIS MOVIE I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE THIS MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_29	BUT IT WAS REALLY GOOD
ZUXBRvtny7o_1	NINE NINETY SCREENING PLUS I AM NUMBER FOUR YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THAT
ZUXBRvtny7o_3	BUT I WENT AND I DIG THIS MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_2	I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE THIS MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_5	PLUS I HAD A GOOD TIME
ZUXBRvtny7o_4	I WAS HAPPY TO SEE IT
ZUXBRvtny7o_7	THE SOUNDTRACK IS GOOD ITS REALLY GOOD SOME REALLY GREAT SONGS
ZUXBRvtny7o_6	IM WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_9	UM ANYWAYS THE MUSIC IS GOOD
ZUXBRvtny7o_8	AND THE BEST THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT ALL TWO SONGS UM WELL NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF THE SONGS ARE NOT WELL WELL CONNECTED WITH THE SCENES
ZUXBRvtny7o_11	I REALLY DIG THE SPECIAL EFFECTS OF THIS MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_10	ITS STUTTERING THAT IS A GOOD THING
ZUXBRvtny7o_13	AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS
ZUXBRvtny7o_12	LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE IT STARTS WITH REALLY GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES
ZUXBRvtny7o_15	ITS IT WAS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_14	AND THE ENDING WAS REALLY REALLY GREAT TOO
ZUXBRvtny7o_17	I MEAN THE BLOOD IS LIKE TWILIGHT WITH SOME SCIFI WITH SOME ACTION AND WITH LIKABLE CHARACTERS AND THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT GUYS
ZUXBRvtny7o_16	THE MAIN PROBLEM OF THIS MOVIE IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS SO CHEESY
ZUXBRvtny7o_19	NOT LIKE THE CHARACTERS OF OF TWILIGHT
ZUXBRvtny7o_18	THE CHARACTERS OF I AM NUMBER FOUR ARE LIKABLE
ZUXBRvtny7o_31	THE LIKABLE CHARACTERS MAKE THIS MOVIE A REALLY GOOD MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_30	THE ACTING IS ITS NORMAL ITS NOT BAD ITS NOT BAD AT ALL
ZUXBRvtny7o_34	SO YEAH IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN THIS WEEKEND GO WATCH IT WATCH THIS MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_33	CAUSE ITS WORTH IT
ZUXBRvtny7o_32	IM WILLING TO GO WITH FRIENDS ALONE WITH FAMILY TO WATCH ON A RAINY DAY AND IF YOU CAN WATCH IT AT HALF PRICE AT A MIDNIGHT SHOW SCREENING
_dI--eQ6qVU_24	BUT THEY TOOK A NEW SPIN ON IT
_dI--eQ6qVU_25	AND I JUST LOVED IT
_dI--eQ6qVU_26	AND I FEEL LIKE EVEN THOUGH THE FIGHTING SEQUENCES WERE A LITTLE BIT LONG IN SOME PLACES T
_dI--eQ6qVU_27	SO I MEANT IF I WAS WEARING 3D GLASSES AND WAS SEEING THIS IN 3D I WOULDVE ENJOYED IT A LOT MORE
_dI--eQ6qVU_20	AND JUST DIFFERENT
_dI--eQ6qVU_21	IT ENGAGES THE AUDIENCE MORE
_dI--eQ6qVU_22	AND I JUST REALLY ENJOYED IT
_dI--eQ6qVU_23	THE GREEN HORNET DID SOMETHING SIMILAR
_dI--eQ6qVU_28	AND I WOULD WANT THE SEQUENCES TO BE EVEN LONGER RATHER THAN SHORTER
_dI--eQ6qVU_1	BUT I CAN SAFELY ASSURE YOU THAT EVEN IF THEY DIDNT IT WOULD STILL BE A HIT
_dI--eQ6qVU_3	I DONT KNOW IF FANS OF THE COMIC WOULD BE AS INCLINED TO SAY THE SAME BECAUSE I DONT KNOW HOW MUCH IT DIFFERS FROM THE COMIC OR RADIO PROGRAM THAT PEOPLE LIKE SO MUCH
_dI--eQ6qVU_2	AND I LOVED IT
_dI--eQ6qVU_5	AND I WOULD TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IT WAS HILARIOUS
_dI--eQ6qVU_4	BUT JUST GOING INTO THIS A AS AN OBSERVER AND SOMEONE WHO HAS NO IDEA IT WAS A FANTASTIC FILM IT WAS SO MUCH FUN
_dI--eQ6qVU_7	AND MOST OF YOU KNOW HES A PRETTY FUNNY GUY
_dI--eQ6qVU_6	IT WAS REALLY REALLY FUNNY
_dI--eQ6qVU_9	SO THAT DOESNT SURPRISE ME
_dI--eQ6qVU_8	AND HE FUNNIED UP THIS MOVIE BIG TIME TOTALLY
_dI--eQ6qVU_11	I FEEL LIKE IF THEY WOUDLNT HAVE INSERTED THE HUMOR INTO THIS MOVIE IT WOULDVE BEEN JUST TOO SERIOUS AND KIND OF BORING IN A SENSE
_dI--eQ6qVU_10	AND THE HUMOR IT WAS KIND OF NECESSARY
_dI--eQ6qVU_13	AND THE ACTION SEQUENCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE TENSED
_dI--eQ6qVU_12	BUT THE HUMOR REALLY JUST NAILED IT
_dI--eQ6qVU_15	WHEN THEY JUST COME UP WITH THESE TOTALLY COMPLETELY NEW STYLIZED WAYS OF DEVELOPING ACTION SEQUENCES
_dI--eQ6qVU_14	I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE DO THIS
_dI--eQ6qVU_17	BUT WHEN THEY FIGURE OUT A NEW WAY TO INTERPRET THIS
_dI--eQ6qVU_16	COZ SURE ITS FUN TO SEE A SUPER HERO GO ROUND AND KICK BAD GUY BUTT YOU KNOW PUNCH KICK WHATEVER BAM
_dI--eQ6qVU_19	THAT MAKES IT MORE VISUALLY TRULY APPEALING
_dI--eQ6qVU_18	AND ADD SOMETHING LIKE AN EXTRA SPARK IN THERE
aiEXnCPZubE_24	THE ACTING COULD BE BETTER AND IS VERY MEDIO
aiEXnCPZubE_25	THERE IS SOME SORT OF GREATNESS TO SUCKER PUNCH THOUGH
aiEXnCPZubE_26	FIRST THE VISUAL EFFECTS HERE ARE STELLAR
aiEXnCPZubE_27	THEY ARE UNIQUE
aiEXnCPZubE_20	BUT THEY YOU KNOW THEY THEY BRING NOTHING TO THIS TABLE
aiEXnCPZubE_21	AND WHICH HURTS THE FILM DRASTICALLY
aiEXnCPZubE_22	BECAUSE THEY ARE INTERESTING CHARACTERS
aiEXnCPZubE_23	AND COULD HAVE INTERESTING BACK STORIES
aiEXnCPZubE_28	INCREDIBLE ICANDY
aiEXnCPZubE_29	AND JUST OVERALL SUPERB
aiEXnCPZubE_1	BROWNING IS MEDIOCRE ROLE
aiEXnCPZubE_3	SHE ISNT TERRIBLE
aiEXnCPZubE_2	THERES NEVER A FEELING OF STAR QUALITY WITH HER
aiEXnCPZubE_5	LIKE THE AVERAGE HORROR FILM THE UNINVITED
aiEXnCPZubE_4	BUT QUITE FRANKLY SHE IS IMPLAUSIBLE
aiEXnCPZubE_7	AND I DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE HATING ON THE FILM BECAUSE I REALLY DO LOVE IT
aiEXnCPZubE_6	AND VISUALLY STUNNING
aiEXnCPZubE_9	AND IS UPSTAGED BY MANY OTHER PERFORMANCES IN THE FILM
aiEXnCPZubE_8	OVERALL BROWNING IS JUST FAILS TO DELIVER
aiEXnCPZubE_11	THE HITS INCLUDE OSCAR ISAAK AS THE MAIN VILLAIN LIKE I SAID BLUE JENA MALONE IS THE SOFT SPOKEN ROCKET AND THE STEALING ABBY CORNISH IS SWEET PEA A TROUBLED AND RELUCTANT YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PACK
aiEXnCPZubE_10	THE SUPPORTING CAST IS EITHER HIT OR MISS
aiEXnCPZubE_13	WHO DOESNT HAVE ANY PRESENTS OR GREATNESS AT ALL
aiEXnCPZubE_12	THE MISSES INCLUDE YOU KNOW VANESSA HUDGENS
aiEXnCPZubE_15	WHOS ACCENT IS SO AWEFUL
aiEXnCPZubE_14	AND THE OTHER HORRIBLE I MEAN ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS CARLA GUGINO AS DOCTOR VERA GORSKI
aiEXnCPZubE_17	AND HER CHARACTER IS ALSO UNDEVELOPED AND WEAK
aiEXnCPZubE_16	AND WHOS IS RIDICULOUS
aiEXnCPZubE_19	AND THEY COULD HAVE GREAT BACK STORIES
aiEXnCPZubE_18	JON HAMM AND SCOTT GLENN COULD BRING YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE INTERESTING CHARACTERS
aiEXnCPZubE_30	AND THE ACTION IN THE MOVIE IS SO WELL USED
atnd_PF-Lbs_11	NOW LET JUST GET INTO TWO THINGS THAT WILL POSSIBLY ATTRACT YOU TO THIS FILM THE VIOLENCE AND THE 3D
atnd_PF-Lbs_10	ITS A JOKE REALLY
atnd_PF-Lbs_13	THE VIOLENCE HERE IS PRETTY BAD
atnd_PF-Lbs_12	VIEWERS PLEASE RESIST FROM THESE TWO
atnd_PF-Lbs_15	THE TIRE DECAPITATION MIGHT NOT SOUND ALL THAT UNIQUE
atnd_PF-Lbs_14	THERERE ABOUT TWO CREATIVE SCENES IN HERE UM ONE BEING IN INTESTINAL JOURNEY THROUGH THE RECTUM IN A SWIMMING POOL DRAIN AND A TIRE DECAPITATION THAT
atnd_PF-Lbs_17	I MEAN NOT THE SICK LIKE OH MY GOD THAT WAS AWESOME
atnd_PF-Lbs_16	BUT THE WAY ITS PULLED OFF ITS LIKE WOW THAT WAS SICK
atnd_PF-Lbs_19	THERES MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF SAYING SICK NOWADAYS
atnd_PF-Lbs_18	NO SICK IN THE OH MY GOD THAT WAS CRAZY THAT KIND OF SICK
atnd_PF-Lbs_20	BUT UM YEAH WOW AGH SAY THAT IN TWO SHEE TWO SCENES DEATH ISNT EVEN NEARLY UNIQUE IS A BIT HARSH
atnd_PF-Lbs_1	ITS BAD
atnd_PF-Lbs_3	IM NOT EVEN GONNA GO TO THE LOWS TO MAKE A WHOLE NIGHT VIDEO ABOUT THIS MOVIE
atnd_PF-Lbs_2	OH GOD THIS IS BAD
atnd_PF-Lbs_5	I HATE IT
atnd_PF-Lbs_4	SO NO NOW KNOW THIS I AM NOT A FAN OF THE FINAL DESTINATION SERIES
atnd_PF-Lbs_7	BUT AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED THIS SERIES IS GARBAGE
atnd_PF-Lbs_6	I MIGHT HAVE TO WATCH THE FIRST TWO AGAIN OR MAYBE JUST THE FIRST ONE TO STABILIZE MY THOUGHTS ON THE SERIES
atnd_PF-Lbs_9	NOW I WONT EVEN TALK ABOUT ACTING COZ ITS JUST SO BAD
atnd_PF-Lbs_8	YOU CAN SENSE MY EXCITEMENT WHEN I HEARD THIS WAS BEING RELEASED
atnd_PF-Lbs_21	THE RACE STADIUM SCENE AND THE MALL SCENES IN THE BEGINNING AND THE END WHERE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE DIE IN THE CRAZIEST WAYS ARE PRETTY GOOD FOR LATE NIGHT BUDDY VIEWING YOU SEE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY LATE NIGHT BUDDY VIEWINGS
bOL9jKpeJRs_24	SO IT WAS JUST A LITTLE AWKWARD
bOL9jKpeJRs_25	SO IT WAS JUST A LITTLE AWKWARD
bOL9jKpeJRs_26	BUT UM WEVE OVERCOME THAT
bOL9jKpeJRs_27	YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE EXPENDABLES EVEN THOUGH IT CAME OUT SUCH A LONG TIME AGAO
bOL9jKpeJRs_20	MY BOYFRIEND GOT REALLY EXCITED WHEN I TOLD HIM WE WERE GONNA GO SEE THE EXPANDABLES
bOL9jKpeJRs_21	AND THAN UM WHEN I WENT TO BLOCKBUSTER AND I PICKED IT UP AND I BROUGHT IT BACK HOME HE GOT REALLY DISAPPOINTED
bOL9jKpeJRs_22	I THINK ITS BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A MOVING FILM
bOL9jKpeJRs_23	AND I DONT THINK HE KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE HIS EMOTIONS IN THAT DEPARTMENT
bOL9jKpeJRs_28	THERES BEEN A LOT OF BUZZ ABOUT IT LATELY AND EVERYONES YOU KNOW A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OVER IT
bOL9jKpeJRs_29	EVERYONES BEEN SAYING ITS REALLY INTENSE
bOL9jKpeJRs_1	AND I WAS UNBELIEVABLY SHOCKED HOW MUCH I LOVED IT
bOL9jKpeJRs_3	GREAT DIALOGUE
bOL9jKpeJRs_2	IT WAS FULL OF ACTION
bOL9jKpeJRs_5	ITS REALLY JUST A HEART WARMING STORY
bOL9jKpeJRs_4	THE CHARACTERS WERE SO GREAT AND WELL DEVELOPED
bOL9jKpeJRs_7	ITS NOT THAT VIOLENT
bOL9jKpeJRs_6	ITS A GREAT MOVIE TO SEE OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOUR WHOLE FAMILY CAN SEE IT
bOL9jKpeJRs_9	I REALLY REALY FELT FOR THE DAD IN THE EXPENDABLES
bOL9jKpeJRs_8	XXX IT IS A TEENYTINY BIT VIOLENT AND NOT ENOUGH SO YOU CAN BRING YOUR 5 YEAR OLD
bOL9jKpeJRs_11	THE DAD WAS JUST REALLY PROTECTIVE
bOL9jKpeJRs_10	BECAUSE HE WAS PROTECTING OVER HIS FAMILY AND AFTER THEY WENT MISSING EVEN THOUGH THEYRE A BEND OF OUTSIDERS AND THAY HAVE ALL THOSE POWERS
bOL9jKpeJRs_13	VERY HEART WARMING
bOL9jKpeJRs_12	AND HE MADE SURE THAT HES WHOLE FAMILY WAS SAFE
bOL9jKpeJRs_15	BRAD BIRD IS A GREAT WRITER AND DIRECTOR
bOL9jKpeJRs_14	VERY TOUCHING
bOL9jKpeJRs_17	IT WAS SO CUTE
bOL9jKpeJRs_16	UM I THINK THAT MY FAVORITE PART OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE WAS WHEN YOU FIND OUT AT THE END THAT THE LITTLE BABY HAD POWERS
bOL9jKpeJRs_19	I REALLY RECOMMEND YOU ALL SEE THE EXPENDABLES
bOL9jKpeJRs_18	JUST THE GREAT GREAT MOVIE
bOL9jKpeJRs_31	THERE ARE PARTS THAT ARE VERY INTENSE
bOL9jKpeJRs_30	I CAN SEE THAT
bOL9jKpeJRs_34	I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LOVE IT
bOL9jKpeJRs_33	SO GO SEE THE EXPENDABLES
bOL9jKpeJRs_32	BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT IS A FAMILY FRIENDLY WARM AND FUZZY MOVIEVOOVIE
bvLlb-M3UXU_24	IT JUST IT FELT KIND OF CUT AND DRY
bvLlb-M3UXU_25	WHICH WOULD START THE PLANNING THAT I WISH IT HAS HAPPENED EARLIER IN THEIR CAREERS
bvLlb-M3UXU_20	AND I DONT KNOW IF THIS SCENE TOOK PLACE FEFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THOSE GUYS WERE ABSOLUTELY PRIME IT WOULDVE BEEN JUST UM ABSOLUTELY BREATH TAKING MONUMENTAL MOMENT IN CINEMATIC HISTORY
bvLlb-M3UXU_21	BUT SEEING IT TODAY NOW WHEN IT WAS REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN JUST A ONE XXX SHIP
bvLlb-M3UXU_22	IT LOST A LOT OF FEELING
bvLlb-M3UXU_23	IT WASNT THE FINAL YOU KNOW FINALLY HAPPENED U UNITING THAT WE ALL COME TO EXPECT
bvLlb-M3UXU_1	AND ITS REALLY WHAT YOU WOULDVE EXPACT
bvLlb-M3UXU_3	THERES LITTLE TO NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT ALL MOVIE
bvLlb-M3UXU_2	ITS NOT A COMPELLING NARRATIVE BY ANY MEANS
bvLlb-M3UXU_5	AND REALLY THERES NO HUMONGOUS TALE TO THESE GUYS
bvLlb-M3UXU_4	AND YET THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLY ENJOYABLE FOR ACTION FANS
bvLlb-M3UXU_7	BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DONT NEED A COMPLECATED FORMULA FOR AN ACTION MOVIE
bvLlb-M3UXU_6	NOT A COMPLICATED STORY
bvLlb-M3UXU_9	THIS MOVIE ESSENTIALLY WAS MADE FOR THREE REASONS IN MY OPINION
bvLlb-M3UXU_8	THERES A BAD GUY GUY GO TAKE HIM DOWN THATS REALLY ALL YOU NEED
bvLlb-M3UXU_11	AND THATS YOU KNOW ALL THATS ALL YOU REALLY NEEDED TO DO
bvLlb-M3UXU_10	THE FIRST REASON IS THE OBVIOUS JUST TO MAKE AN EXCITING ENJOYABLE ACTION FILM
bvLlb-M3UXU_13	THE SECOND REASON THIS MOVIE WAS MADE AND IN MY OPINION THE REAL REASON IT WAS MADE AGAIN ITS SILVESTRE STALONE TELLING HIMSELF I STILL GOT IT
bvLlb-M3UXU_12	AND DEFINATELLY COMES THROUGH ON THAT
bvLlb-M3UXU_15	HES IN TERRIFIC SHAPE FOR A MAN TWICE MY AGE WHO LOOKS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN ME
bvLlb-M3UXU_14	UM IVE GOT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT
bvLlb-M3UXU_17	BUT HEY WHATEVER AND IS SHOWING YEAH MAYBE HES NOT WHAT HE WAS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BUT HE STILL HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE BILLED AS AN ACTION STAR
bvLlb-M3UXU_16	THATS KIND OF MADE ME FEEL DEPRESSED
bvLlb-M3UXU_19	BECAUSE YOU KNOW ITS BASICALLY IT WAS STALONE KNOWING THESE GUYS ARENT IN THE SHAPE THEY WERE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO
bvLlb-M3UXU_18	THERES ACTUALLY YEAH YEAH SCENES TRIPLE STAND OFF WITH SILVESTRE ARNOLD SWARZENEGER BRUCE WILLIS AND YEAH ACTUALLY IN A WAY KIND OF FELL HOLLOW
c5xsKMxpXnc_11	I MEAN YOU DONT SEE WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER
c5xsKMxpXnc_10	AND IT IS VERY RUSHED
c5xsKMxpXnc_13	LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BUT NONE WHERE THESE TWO SHOULD BE TOGETHER
c5xsKMxpXnc_12	THERES NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT REALLY WITH THESE TWO
c5xsKMxpXnc_15	YOU DONT SEE WHY THEY SHOULD LIKE EACH OTHER CAUSE THEY DONT SHOW IT IN THE MOVIE
c5xsKMxpXnc_14	THERES NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD BE TOGETHER
c5xsKMxpXnc_1	AND I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GONNA BE REALLY GOOD BECAUSE MATT DAMON WAS IN IT
c5xsKMxpXnc_3	LIKE THEY TALK FOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES AND INSTANTLY KISS WHICH IS DUMB
c5xsKMxpXnc_2	AND I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED
c5xsKMxpXnc_5	BUT THEY DID NOT EXECUTE IT VERY WELL
c5xsKMxpXnc_4	WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THE CONCEPT WAS COOL
c5xsKMxpXnc_7	THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE FOR THESE REASONS
c5xsKMxpXnc_6	AND THEY LEFT A LOT OF PLOT HOLES
c5xsKMxpXnc_9	YOU DONT FEEL THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER
c5xsKMxpXnc_8	NUMBER ONE BECAUSE THE LOVE IS FORCED
c7UH_rxdZv4_24	AND HE WAS STILL BORING
c7UH_rxdZv4_25	UM YEAH THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE OK
c7UH_rxdZv4_26	NOTHING THATS WORTH GOING TO THEATERS TO SEE
c7UH_rxdZv4_27	AND YEAH I THINK THE ONLY CHARACTER WHO ACTUALLY SHOWED THEIR MOTIVATION BIHIND ANYTHING THEY DID WAS THE VILLAIN
c7UH_rxdZv4_20	AND THAN CAMERON DIAZ WHOS SUPPOSED TO BE PLUCKY I GUESS BUT SHES JUST KINF OF USELESS
c7UH_rxdZv4_21	HI IM PRETTY I HAVE A GIANT SMILE IM SUPPOSED TO KNOW THINGSUM WALK OF SCREEN
c7UH_rxdZv4_22	UM YEAH THE CHARACTERS DIDNT CARE WEATHER THEY LIVED OR DIED
c7UH_rxdZv4_23	KATO WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS ANY GOOD WHATSOEVER
c7UH_rxdZv4_28	HE WAS THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT WAS SLIGHTLY INTERESTING
c7UH_rxdZv4_29	WHO SEEMED TO HAVE GENUINE AFFECTION FOR OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
c7UH_rxdZv4_1	OH MY GOSH BAD MOVIE
c7UH_rxdZv4_3	I WISH I WERENT
c7UH_rxdZv4_2	REALLY BAD MOVIE
c7UH_rxdZv4_5	BUT BASICALLY SETH ROGAN BROUGHT NONE OF THE CHARM THAT HE NORMALLY DOES TO HIS ROLES
c7UH_rxdZv4_4	BECAUSE I TRULY LOVE AN ACTION FLICK ACTION COMEDY FLICK EVEN BETTER RIGHT
c7UH_rxdZv4_7	YEAP A HORRIBLE PROTAGONIST
c7UH_rxdZv4_6	IN FACT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE OBNOXIOUS MAIN CHARACTERS IVE SEEN A LONG TIME
c7UH_rxdZv4_9	AND UNLIKE OTHER FILMS FOR THEY KIND OF A NARCISSTIC XXX BOY BUT THEY BRING SOMETHING TO THE TABLE YOU KNOW
c7UH_rxdZv4_8	HE UM HAD ALL THE CHARM OF A NARCISSIST XXX BOY THE WHOLE FILM
c7UH_rxdZv4_11	YOURE LIKE OH THEYRE STILL KIND OF COOL
c7UH_rxdZv4_10	THERES SOMETHING THAT JUST KIND OF MAKES THAM SO SL SLIGHTLY ENDEARING EVEN THOUGH THEYRE KIND OF THE JACK ASS YOU KNOW
c7UH_rxdZv4_13	UM HES JUST A JACK ASS
c7UH_rxdZv4_12	NO NO HES UNFUNNY NOT FUNNY AT ALL
c7UH_rxdZv4_15	BORING
c7UH_rxdZv4_14	UM KATO KICKS ASS HANDSOME GUY
c7UH_rxdZv4_17	JUST LIKE LOOK AWAY WHAT HE CAN DO HE CAN DO LOTS OF STUFF

c7UH_rxdZv4_19	YOU CANT EVEN TELL FUNNY JOKES
c7UH_rxdZv4_18	WHAT WA WHAT HES WHAT W WHY YOU HAVE NO SKILLS WHATSOEVER
c7UH_rxdZv4_31	I MEAN THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT SHOWS GENUINE CARE FOR OTHER PEOPLE BE THE VILLAIN
c7UH_rxdZv4_30	AND IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING
c7UH_rxdZv4_33	DONT SEE IT

d6hH302o4v8_23	AND THIS IS THE WORST BY FAR
d6hH302o4v8_28	BUT THE LAST HALF HOUR OF THE MOVIE IT FELT LIKE THEY HAD ADDED LIKE A CGI ORGASM
d6hH302o4v8_29	YOU KNOW THEY JUST TRIED UH WITH THE CGI THAT THEY PUT T T T THEY THEY THREW SO MUCH CGI AT YOU

d6hH302o4v8_33	IT WAS TERRIBLE
d6hH302o4v8_32	LIKE EVERY SINGLE SCENE WAS CGI
dq3Nf_lMPnE_11	AND THEIR PLACE IS A RUN OF THE MILL ANIMATED ACTION ADVENTURE PLOT WITH A FEW CHUCKLES TROWN IN
dq3Nf_lMPnE_10	AND ALSO THE CUTE WINGS TO POP CULTURE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_13	IF AWARD FOR THE GREAT CHARACTERS OF SHREK IN HIS SUPPORTING CAST THEY ARE STILL VOICED BY THE ORIGINAL STARS MIKE MYERS EDDIE MURPHY CAMERON DIAZ AND ANTONIO BANDERAS THE FILM WOULD BE A REAL BUST
dq3Nf_lMPnE_12	IT SEEMS LIKE THE WRITERS AND CREATORS TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT
dq3Nf_lMPnE_15	I GIVE SHREK FOREVER AFTER DIRECTED BY MIKE MITCHELL A GRADE OF B MINUS
dq3Nf_lMPnE_14	UNLESS YOUR KIDS ARE DYING TO SEE IT ID WAIT FOR THE DVD
dq3Nf_lMPnE_1	XXX WHITNESSING THE CHANGES AND GROWTH OF THE CHARACTERS ITS USAULALY A PATH OF DISCOVERY
dq3Nf_lMPnE_3	DREAMWORKS IS CONFUSING ME
dq3Nf_lMPnE_2	THE LAST MINUTE TITLE THAT THEY THREW ON AT THE THEATERS
dq3Nf_lMPnE_5	EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN SHREK 1 2 AND 3 ARE WIPED AWAY
dq3Nf_lMPnE_4	THEY SOLVED THIS DILEMMA BY REMOVING THE PAST WITHIN ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE TWIST COURTECY OF NEW BETTY RUMPELSTILTSKIN
dq3Nf_lMPnE_7	BUT ALSO NOT VERY ORIGINAL
dq3Nf_lMPnE_6	NOT A BAD IDEA FOR A SEQUEL
dq3Nf_lMPnE_9	GONE ARE THE WICKEDLY SATIRICAL STAND UPS OF THE WORLD OF FAIRY TALES
dq3Nf_lMPnE_8	SHREK 4 MISSES OUT ON THE MAGIC THAT MADE THE FIRST FILM A REAL JOY TO VIEW
etzxEpPuc6I_11	LIKE LIKE EVEN THE ACTORS WERE JUST LIKE YOU KNOW ITS A MOVIE ABOUT A FUCKING TOY
etzxEpPuc6I_10	THE PLOT IS RIDICULOUS BUT NO ONE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY
etzxEpPuc6I_13	LIKE THIS ONE PART WHERE THE GIRLS LIKE MY DADDY TAUGHT ME TO WIN WIN AND THEN SHES LOOKING IN THE CAMERA AND IM LIKE WOW LIKE UM THIS ACTINGS PRETTY BAD
etzxEpPuc6I_12	LAUGHING SO THEYRE JUST SITTING THERE
etzxEpPuc6I_15	LIKE KNOWING IS HALF THE BATTLE
etzxEpPuc6I_14	BUT THE THEY THEY KNEW IT WAS JUST A MOVIE ABOUT A A A A DOLL SO THEY DIDNT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY
etzxEpPuc6I_17	LIKE IT WAS LIKE THE ACTING WAS TERRIBLE THE ACTION MADE UP FOR IT
etzxEpPuc6I_16	BUT THE MOVIE WAS WELL IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY TERRIBLE
etzxEpPuc6I_19	IVE SEEN PEOPLE GET SHOT IN THE EYE YOU KNOW AND THAT WOULD BE IT BUT PEOPLE GETTING SHOT IN THE EYE AND THEN THE THEY HEADS EXPLODE AND THEN SOME DUDE GET HIS TORSO CUT OPEN AND AND SOME DUDES HANGING OUT OF THE CAR HIS HEAD GOT BLOWN OFF AND FREAKING PEOPLE ARE FLYING AND JUMPING
etzxEpPuc6I_18	THERE WAS PARTS THIS IVE SEEN SOME CREATIVE DEPTHS IN THIS MOVIE IVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
etzxEpPuc6I_1	UM SO CHANNING TATUM AND MARLON ARE TRANSPORTING IT THEY GET AMBUSHED BY UM I THINK ITS COBRA ITS KINDA HARD TO EXPLAIN IT
etzxEpPuc6I_3	UM FROM THERE IT JUST GOES INTO RIDICULOUSNESS
etzxEpPuc6I_2	CUZ ITS LIKE THE DUDE THAT MADE THE TECHNOLOGIES I I CANT RUIN THE MOVIE
etzxEpPuc6I_5	I WAS LIKE YOU KNOW THEYRE BOTH HASBRO TOYS THEYRE BOTH MOVES THAT ARE COM MADE FOR CHILDREN
etzxEpPuc6I_4	THE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS LIKE I I I WANNA COMPARE IT TO TRANSFORMERS 2 AND I ACTUALLY DID
etzxEpPuc6I_7	BUT THE THING ABOUT GI JOE COMPARED TO TRANSFORMERS IS TRANSFOMERS 2 DIDNT KNOW WHAT IT WANTED TO DO
etzxEpPuc6I_6	BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF ADULT SITUATIONS IN IT
etzxEpPuc6I_9	AS FOR GI JOE WAS IT WAS JUST LIKE LAUGHING ITS THE THE PLOT THE THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE
etzxEpPuc6I_8	LIKE IN SOME PARTS YOU HAD PEOPLE GETTING KILLED AND THE NEXT PART YOU HAD FART JOKES AND STUPID FRAT HUMOR AND ALL THAT OTHER CRAP
f9O3YtZ2VfI_24	BUT ITS ITS LIKE SOMEONE MADE YOU A KICK ASS SANDWICH BUT THEY PUT MAYONNAISE ON IT AND YOU DONT LIKE MAYONNAISE AND ITS NOT LIKE TOMATO OR LETTUCE WHERE YOU CAN PICK IT OFF NO ITS GOT IT MAYONNAISE IN ITS ALL OVER EVERYTHING AND NOW YOURE STUCK WITH THIS KICK ASS SANDWICH THAT WOULD BE KICK ASS IF IT DIDNT HAVE MAYONNAISE ON IT BUT IT HAS MAYONNAISE ON IT OR YOU GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH
f9O3YtZ2VfI_25	THIS MOVIE IS JUST NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH
f9O3YtZ2VfI_26	I REALLY LIKED DAVID FINCH
f9O3YtZ2VfI_27	I LIKED ALL THE UM I LIKE THE CAST
f9O3YtZ2VfI_20	BUT DONT GET ME WRONG ITS NOT ALL BAD
f9O3YtZ2VfI_21	ITS GOT MY TWO FAVORITE ACRESSES IN IT TILDA SWINTON AND CATE BLANCHETT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_22	LIKE I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY INTERESTING IDEA
f9O3YtZ2VfI_23	AND THEY DID A LOT OF GOOD THINGS WITH IT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_28	BUT AND ITS A GOOD STORY
f9O3YtZ2VfI_29	BUT CLAP HUH ITS A PASS
f9O3YtZ2VfI_1	WHAT WHATEVER THE NAME IS TOO LONG
f9O3YtZ2VfI_3	AND ITS THEY LOOKED LIKE IT HAD A GOOD CORE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_2	ITS A VERY INTERESTING IDEA
f9O3YtZ2VfI_5	THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT ITS ALL TOLD IN FLASHBACK FROM A POINT JUST BEFORE KATRINA HITS NEW ORLEANS
f9O3YtZ2VfI_4	BUT HM IT JUST TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH IT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_7	I DONT NEED IT ALL TOLD IN FLASHBACK
f9O3YtZ2VfI_6	I DIDNT NEED ANY OF THAT CRAP
f9O3YtZ2VfI_9	IT DOSENT IT JUST ITS TOO MUCH CRAP IN HERE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_8	I DONT NEED THE ADDED ELEMENT OF KATRINA
f9O3YtZ2VfI_11	THEY JUST NEED TO CUT THAT OUT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_10	THE THE MOVIES IS TOO LONG
f9O3YtZ2VfI_13	TH WE DO NOT NEED THE ENTIRE SPAN BIRTH TO DEATH
f9O3YtZ2VfI_12	ANOTHER THING IS WE DONT NEED HIS ENTIRE LIFE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_15	AND SCALE IT DOWN ON LIKE TWO HOURS
f9O3YtZ2VfI_14	JUST GIVE ME A NICE INTERESTING CHOKE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_17	UM AND IF YOURE GONNA DO MOSTLY CGI JUST MAKE AN ANIMATED MOVIE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_16	THIS ALSO FALLS IN TO THE TRANDY IS VERY POPULAR THESE DAYS IF YOU DO A WHOLE ALL OF CGI
f9O3YtZ2VfI_19	MAKES HIM LOOK TOO TOO GOOD
f9O3YtZ2VfI_18	THIS LOOKS LIKE IT JUST HAS A POLYURETHANE COATING ON IT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_30	MY NEIGHBOR PROBABLY THINKS IM CRAZY YELLING ABOUT MOVIES TO A CAMERA
f_pcplsH_V0_11	NOW I DIDNT REALLY LIKE THE FIRST HOUR THAT MUCH THOUGH
f_pcplsH_V0_10	BUT I THINK THIS ONE DID BEAT SCREAM 2
f_pcplsH_V0_13	I THINK XXX I WANT TO SEE IT
f_pcplsH_V0_12	IM SURE YOU ALL REMEMBER THE STAB MOVIES THAT WERE BASED ON THE SCREAM MOVIES OR THE EXPERIENCES OF SIDNEY IN UNIVERSE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD COMMENT ON THE KILLERS REENACTING THE MOVIES OR FOLLOWING UP THE MOVIES WELL IN THE FIRST HOUR THOSE BECOME WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH OF A PLOT POINT BASICALLY
f_pcplsH_V0_15	IM JUST KINDA LIKE NO THIS IS GOING TO FAR
f_pcplsH_V0_14	BUT IT ACTUALLY BASICALLY MAKES THE CHARACTERS CONGITION NOT JUST OF THE GENRE WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE IN BUT OF THEIR OWN FRANCHISE TO A RIDICULOUS EXTENT
f_pcplsH_V0_1	SO YOU BETTER APPRECIATE THIS REVIEW
f_pcplsH_V0_3	THEYRE BACK TO YOU HAVING TWO KILLERS THANKFULLY
f_pcplsH_V0_2	BUT TO ANY OF YOU WHO ARE I EXPECT A THUMBS UP
f_pcplsH_V0_5	HMPH MY OVERALL OPINION OF THE RESULTS OF THIS PROCESS ARE ITS BETTER THAN SCREAM 3
f_pcplsH_V0_4	BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE HAVING THE KILLER BE ABLE TO BE EVERYWHERE IF THERES TWO OF THEM
f_pcplsH_V0_7	A LOT OF PEOPLE DONT LIKE SCREAM 2
f_pcplsH_V0_6	AND ACTUALLY IS BETTER THAN SCREAM 2
f_pcplsH_V0_9	I HATED SCREAM 3
f_pcplsH_V0_8	I THINK ITS HIGHLY UNDERRATED
fvVhgmXxadc_11	AND LATER TIME SHE GOES LIKE A WORLD WAR II BATTLEFIELD UM CASTLE THIS KIND OF PULLED OUT OF LORD OF THE RINGS
fvVhgmXxadc_10	IN FACT THE FIRST TIME SHE GOES IN IT LOOKS LIKE A JAPANESE TEMPLE
fvVhgmXxadc_13	ITS KIND OF PLAYING WITH THE IDEA WHATS REAL WHATS NOT WHAT THE MATRIX FILMS DID
fvVhgmXxadc_12	WHATS IN HER MIND WITHIN HER MIND IN A WAY ITS KIND OF LIKE INCEPTION IN THAT WAY
fvVhgmXxadc_14	ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY THE BEST COMPARISON THIS IS THIS FILM WOULD ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING LIKE PANS LABYRINTH
fvVhgmXxadc_1	IT ONLY HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A FILM THAT WAS BOTH PROVKING AND ACTION PACKED
fvVhgmXxadc_3	THAT I GOT VERY LITTLE JOY OUT OF
fvVhgmXxadc_2	BUT UNFORTUNATELY ITS JUST AN UGLY WILD VIOLENT UNVOLVING AND SADISTIC EXERCISE
fvVhgmXxadc_5	THATS PRETTY HEAVILY INFERRED IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE
fvVhgmXxadc_4	IN FACT I GOT MOSTLY PAIN OUT OF IT
fvVhgmXxadc_7	NOW IT ALSO TAKES SO REALLY CREEPY XXXOF THE FACT THAT EMILY BROWNING IN THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE SHES UNDERAGE
fvVhgmXxadc_6	WHEN SHE GETS THERE IS FORCED TO NOT ONLY BE TRAPPED IN THE VOCATION THAT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESNT WANNA BE IN
fvVhgmXxadc_9	THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE VIDEO GAME IN A CERTAIN WAY
fvVhgmXxadc_8	BUT I DONT KNOW
iiK8YX8oH1E_11	SO I WILL GIVE IT POINTS FOR NOT BEING EXACTLY LIKE MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING EVEN AT THE TRAILER SETS IT UP THAT WAY
iiK8YX8oH1E_10	AND WE SECOND GUESS OURSELVES
iiK8YX8oH1E_13	BUT I DONT THINK SHES LEADING MATERIAL
iiK8YX8oH1E_12	GINNIFER GOODWIN IS FUN TO WATCH
iiK8YX8oH1E_15	IF THERE IS ANY SILVERLINING IN THIS MOVIE ITS JOHN KRASINSKI
iiK8YX8oH1E_14	AND LIKE I SAID KATE HUDSON COULDNT BE MORE ANNOYING HERE
iiK8YX8oH1E_17	BUT HE HAS SOME OF THE FUNNIEST SCENES IN THIS MOVIE
iiK8YX8oH1E_16	WHO I DONT USUALLY LIKE
iiK8YX8oH1E_18	HE SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY REALISTIC CHARACTER HERE
iiK8YX8oH1E_1	ITS ONE OF THOSE ROMANTIC COMEDIES THAT WE ALL DREAD
iiK8YX8oH1E_3	ANNOYINGLY SHE KIND OF YELLS AND SCREAMS THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE
iiK8YX8oH1E_2	NOW THE REAL STAR OF SOMETHING BORROWED IS GINNIFER GOODWIN
iiK8YX8oH1E_5	UM IT KIND OF FOLLOWS THE PATH OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING 1997 JULIA ROBERTS MOVIE EXCEPT IT TAKES THIRTY MINUTES LONGER TO DEVIATE FROM THE SCRIPTS OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING
iiK8YX8oH1E_4	AND IF YOU CAN TOLERATE HER THE REST OF THE MOVIE ISNT ANY BATTER
iiK8YX8oH1E_7	BUT MOSTLY ITS JUST KATE HUDSON BEING VERY ANNOYING
iiK8YX8oH1E_6	THERE ARE SOME FUNNY MOMENTS
iiK8YX8oH1E_9	I THINK WITH WITH THESE KIND OF MOVIES WE KIND OF PREDICT
iiK8YX8oH1E_8	AND I THINK ITS PREDICTABLE UP AN TO A POINT
jUzDDGyPkXU_24	BUT I KINDA WOULD HAVE READ THAT BEEN LIKE HM I MEAN SCHWARZANEGGER NEVER SAID ANYTHING REALLY THAT BADASS IN HIS MOVIES
jUzDDGyPkXU_25	BUT ARITE AND MOVING ON THERES NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN THIS MOVIE NONE
jUzDDGyPkXU_26	WELL I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I DONT REMEMBER THE NAMES OF ANY CHARACTERS NONE OF THEM WERE MEMBORABLE
jUzDDGyPkXU_27	AND THEY WERE ALL JUST REALLY BLAND AND FORGETTABLE
jUzDDGyPkXU_20	EVERYTHING THEY SAY JUST SOUNDS SO FUCKING STUPID
jUzDDGyPkXU_21	THE ONLY ACTOR WHO CAN REALLY SELL THEIR LINES IS ERIN ECKART
jUzDDGyPkXU_22	THERE ARE MOMENTS WHERE HE SAYS SOMETHING YOURE LIKE THAT JUST SOUNDED DUMB AS HELL
jUzDDGyPkXU_23	BUT HE TOTALLY SELLS IT
jUzDDGyPkXU_1	THE ACTION IS FUCKING AWESOME
jUzDDGyPkXU_3	ITS VERY REMINSCENT OF DISTRICT
jUzDDGyPkXU_2	THE ACTION IS REALLY REALLY WELL DIRECTED
jUzDDGyPkXU_5	BUT IT DIDNT TURN OUT QUITE NEARLY AS AWESOME AS THAT MOVIE DID
jUzDDGyPkXU_4	9 ITS LIKE SOMEONE WATCHED THE THIRD ACT OF DISTRICT 9 A BUNCH OF TIMES LIKE LETS MAKE THIS INTO AN ENTIRE MOVIE ITLL BE AWESOME AND THATS PRETTY MUCH WHAT THEY DID HERE
jUzDDGyPkXU_7	I DIDNT REALLY SEE A COMPARISON TO BLACK HAWK DOWN UNTIL LIKE THE VERY VERY END
jUzDDGyPkXU_6	IN FACT THIS MOVIE ISNT EVEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DISTRICT 9 NOR IS IT UM FOR UH BLACK HAWK DOWN WHICH PEOPLE ARE COMPARING IT TO
jUzDDGyPkXU_9	THE ALIENS ARE REALLY AWESOME
jUzDDGyPkXU_8	BUT NEVERTHELESS ANOTHER REALLY COOL THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
jUzDDGyPkXU_11	AND THEY HAVE REALLY COOL TECHNOLOGY THATS REALLY INTERESTING TO WATCH LIKE MAKE THEM BLOW UP SHIT AND YOU KNOW
jUzDDGyPkXU_10	THEY DESIGNED THE ALIENS IN A REALLY COOL UNIQUE WAY TO MAKE THEM LIKE BIOTIC BUT ALSO MECHANICAL
jUzDDGyPkXU_13	BUT ITS NOT ALWAYS QUITE EXPLAINED YOU KNOW LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ALIENS
jUzDDGyPkXU_12	AND THEY ALWAYS LIKE PULL OUT SOMETHING NEW
jUzDDGyPkXU_15	LIKE ENOUGH THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A GOOD REASON WHY THEY WHY THEYRE ATTACKING
jUzDDGyPkXU_14	BUT THEY GIVE YOU A GOOD AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEM
jUzDDGyPkXU_17	UH THE DIALOGUE IS TERRIBLE
jUzDDGyPkXU_16	AND IT KEEPS YOUR INTERESTS IN THE ACTION SCENES AT LEAST DURING THIS MOVIE
jUzDDGyPkXU_19	NOTHING IN THIS MOVIE IS CLEVERLY WRITTEN
jUzDDGyPkXU_18	THERE IS NO GOOD DIALOGUE
k5Y_838nuGo_24	BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME ADULT HUMOUR
k5Y_838nuGo_25	THOSE ARE QUOTE IN THIS MOVIE THAT SOUNDED SO DIRTY COMING OUT
k5Y_838nuGo_26	BUT IT AS GREAT
k5Y_838nuGo_27	YES UM SOMETHING ABOUT WAFFLE HOLE AM I THE ONLY ONE AM I PERVERTED NOT TO THINK THAT THAT SOUNDS DIRTY COZ IT TOTALLY DOES WAFFLE HOLE
k5Y_838nuGo_20	THE THIRD ONE WAS MORE KID HUMOUR THOUGH
k5Y_838nuGo_21	IT DIDNT HAVE THAT MUCH ADULT HUMOUR IN IT
k5Y_838nuGo_22	UM YEAH THE FOURTH ONE IT DOES HAVE KID HUMOUR DEFINATELLY
k5Y_838nuGo_23	ITS A KIDS MOVIE
k5Y_838nuGo_28	IT HAD ME LAUGHING OUT LOUD
k5Y_838nuGo_29	AND I DONT THINK THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING ABOUT IT
k5Y_838nuGo_1	WHICH I WAS NOT EXCITED TO SEE
k5Y_838nuGo_3	AND I HAVE TO ADMIT I I LIKE SHREK I DO
k5Y_838nuGo_2	AND IT ACTUALLY SURPRISED ME
k5Y_838nuGo_5	UM THEYVE BECOME QUITE A BIT OVERRATED
k5Y_838nuGo_4	I LIKE THE FIRST TWO SHREKS QUITE A BIT
k5Y_838nuGo_7	THE THIRD ONE WAS A PIECE OF CRAP
k5Y_838nuGo_6	BUT THE FIRST TWO WERE PRETTY EXCELLENT
k5Y_838nuGo_9	UM WHICH ACTUALLY WAS REALLY GOOD
k5Y_838nuGo_8	AND THATS WHY I WAS NOT EXCITED ABOUT THE FOURTH ONE
k5Y_838nuGo_11	UM I I DID ENJOY IT
k5Y_838nuGo_10	I DID LIKE THE FOURTH ONE QUITE A BIT
k5Y_838nuGo_13	AND IT JUST WAS BETTER
k5Y_838nuGo_12	IT REMINDED ME OF THE FIRST ONE HAD THE SAME KIND OF VIBE LIKE THE FIRST ONE
k5Y_838nuGo_15	COZ THE FIRST TWO WERE GREAT AND THEY BROUGHT IN THE KIDS AND IT MADE IT MORE KIDDY FRIENDLY MOVIE
k5Y_838nuGo_14	MAYBE ITS THE BABY OGRES MAYBE BRINGING IN THE BABY OGRES REALLY BROUGHT IT DOWN
k5Y_838nuGo_17	BUT THEY WERE HAD ADULT HUMOUR
k5Y_838nuGo_16	THE FIRST TWO WERE KID MOVIES
k5Y_838nuGo_19	AND WOULD GO OVER THE KIDS HEADS AND THIS IS WHAT THE FOURTH ONE KIND OF HAS
k5Y_838nuGo_18	I THOUGH THAT ADULTS WOULD APPRECIATE
k5Y_838nuGo_31	BECAUSE MY ONE OF MY COUSINS DOESNT LIKE THE GLASSES
k5Y_838nuGo_30	UM YEAH ITS ITS BETTER THAN THE THIRD ONE ABSOLUTELY
lXPQBPVc5Cw_24	LIKE I DONT UNDERSTAND
lXPQBPVc5Cw_25	LIKE I I ACTUALLY FELT MYSELF CHECKING THE TIME CUZ I WAS LIKE WHEN IS THIS MOVIE GOING TO END
lXPQBPVc5Cw_26	I DO NOT WANNA SEE ANY MORE OF THIS

lXPQBPVc5Cw_20	UM YEAH SO WE WERE OUT FOR MOST OF IT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT I WAS TEXTING I JUST LIKE I HAD ABSOLUTELY THE FILM HAD NO DRAW TO ME
lXPQBPVc5Cw_21	THE BEGINNING STARTED OFF GREAT WITH A COUPLE GOOD JOKES
lXPQBPVc5Cw_22	AND REALLY FUNNY UH ANIMATION STUFF IT WAS GREAT REALLY FUNNY
lXPQBPVc5Cw_23	UM AND THEN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE IT WAS LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON
lXPQBPVc5Cw_28	UM IN GENERAL UM THE LITTLE KIDS SEEMED TO LIKE IT THAT WERE IN THERE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_29	BUT THE ADULTS WERE THE ADULTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO WATCH IT AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MY AGE AS WELL WERE LIKE WHAT DID I JUST SEE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_1	YES WHEN YOU HEAR JOHNNY DEPP YOU THINK UH THIS MOVIE HAS TO BE GOOD
lXPQBPVc5Cw_3	IT WAS REALLY BORING TO ME
lXPQBPVc5Cw_2	IM NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU IT WASNT GOOD
lXPQBPVc5Cw_5	I GO FOR LIKE THE MORE OLDIES TYPE TYPE FILMS I GUESS LIKE THE OLDER PIXAR FILMS LIKE TOY STORY AND ALL THAT STUFF
lXPQBPVc5Cw_4	CHUCKLING I MEAN AND I DONT ACTUALLY GO AND IM NOT BEING BIASED BECAUSE I DONT REALLY GO FOR THE ANIMATED TYPE FILMS
lXPQBPVc5Cw_7	LAUGHING YOU KNOW A MOVIES TERRIBLE WHEN A PERSON TRYING TO REVIEW IT DOESNT EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY BUT I DONT KNOW THIS MOVIE WAS
lXPQBPVc5Cw_6	UM BUT THIS ONE WAS UH I DONT KNOW I MEAN THE STORY WAS THERE BUT SIGH I DONT KNOW
lXPQBPVc5Cw_9	BUT IT WAS JUST IT WAS LIKE IM NOT GONNA EVEN LIE TO YOU GUYS I FELL ASLEEP AROUND THE MIDDLE OF IT AND WOKE UP LIKE WHAT JUST HAPPENED
lXPQBPVc5Cw_8	UH JOHNNY DEPP DOING THE VOICE WAS FANTASTIC
lXPQBPVc5Cw_11	IT WASNT THERE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_10	UM ITS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES WHERE MOST OF THE FUNNY PARTS ARE IN THE COMMERCIAL YOU KNOW YOUVE SEEN THE COMMERCIAL SO MANY TIMES THAT THAT PART ISNT EVEN FUNNY ANYMORE AND THEN YOURE WONDERING WHERE THE HELL IS THE REST OF IT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_13	THE VOICE ACTING WAS PHENOMENAL
lXPQBPVc5Cw_12	IT JUST WASNT IT DI DID NOT WORK FOR ME
lXPQBPVc5Cw_15	IT WAS SO BAD I JUST DID NOT ENJOY IT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_14	BUT THE THE ACTUAL STORY LINE WAS JUST TERRIBLE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_17	IM NOT EVEN KIDDING I WENT WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS AND A MOVIES SUPPOSED TO BE TEN TIMES BETTER WHEN YOURE WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS
lXPQBPVc5Cw_16	UH I WILL I WILL ACTUALLY SAY THIS RIGHT NOW IT WAS A GOOD WASTE OF LIKE 12
lXPQBPVc5Cw_19	AND THE TWO OTHERS WERE JUST BORED
lXPQBPVc5Cw_18	AND UH MY FRIEND NEXT TO ME FELL ASLEEP
lXPQBPVc5Cw_30	I UH JESUS I DONT KNOW IT WAS SIGH ITS SAD THOUGH BECAUSE I EXPECTED SO MUCH MO
nbWiPyCm4g0_10	MIRANDA MIRANDA WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS
nbWiPyCm4g0_1	AND LET ME TELL YOU IT SURPASSED ITSELF
nbWiPyCm4g0_3	THIS MOVIE ISNT JUST BAD ITS DIABOLICAL
nbWiPyCm4g0_2	IT REACHED THE NEW HIGHTS OF HORRENDOUS
nbWiPyCm4g0_5	ALSO IF YOURE A STREIGHT MAN AND YOU VOLUNTARILY WILLINGLY GOO AND SEE THIS FILM IM GONNA NEED YOU TO LIGHT A CANDLE SAY A PRAYER AND ASK YOURSELF SOME QUESTIONS
nbWiPyCm4g0_4	FIRST LET ME JUST SAY I SAW QUITE A FEW GUYS AT THE CINEMA WHO CLEARLY BEEN DRAGGED THERE BY THE GIRLFRIENDS AND TO THOSE GUYS I SAY WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SEW YOUR BALLS BACK ON FOR YOU
nbWiPyCm4g0_7	WHERE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT LIES NOT ENTIRELY SURE
nbWiPyCm4g0_6	THIS IS REALLY JUST A CONTINUATION OF THE FIRST FILM
nbWiPyCm4g0_9	I DONT KNOW IF CHARLOTTE STARTED ON MADE ME NEVER WANT TO HAVE KIDS OR NEVER WANT TO HAVE RICH FRIENDS
nbWiPyCm4g0_8	LET ME SEE IF I CAN RUSTLE UP SOME SYMPHATY YEAH IVE GOT NOTHING
nzpVDcQ0ywM_24	AND HE DELIVERS A LOT OF INTENSITY
nzpVDcQ0ywM_20	HE IS AVERAGE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_21	AND ITS SH SO SHORT LIVED HE BARELY NEEDS TO EVEN BE THERE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_22	UH STORMSHADOW IS VERY COOL
nzpVDcQ0ywM_23	HIS FIGHT SEQUENCES ARE VERY NEAT
nzpVDcQ0ywM_1	AND HE REALLY SEEMS TO BE CHANNELING MICHAEL BAY IN THIS MOVIE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_3	AND ITS REALLY GLOSSED OVER WITH LOTS OF STUNNING SPECIAL EFFECTS AND BIG EXPLOSIONS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_2	THE PLOT HAS THE CONSISTENCY OF SWISS CHEESE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_5	I FEEL LIKE IT ALMOST SHOULD HAVE HAD A G RATING
nzpVDcQ0ywM_4	SIGH ALL IN ALL ITS KIND OF A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ANY OF US WHO GREW UP IN THE 80S AND ARE USED TO THE TOYS IN THE CARTOON
nzpVDcQ0ywM_7	AND I HATE TO SAY THAT
nzpVDcQ0ywM_6	IT WAS REALLY KIND OF DUMB DOWN FOR US
nzpVDcQ0ywM_9	BUT IF YOU ARE A CHILD WHO GREW UP IN THAT TIME PERIOD YOURE NOT GOING TO ENJOY THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH
nzpVDcQ0ywM_8	I THINK YOU WILL REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE 8
nzpVDcQ0ywM_11	AND ALL I CAN IS HES A PRETTY AVERAGE GUY
nzpVDcQ0ywM_10	BECAUSE THEY ARENT PLAYING TO YOU THEYRE PLAYING TO A NEW AUDIENCE OF KIDS WHO DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE CHARACTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_13	MARLON WAYANS KIND OF PLAYS A WATERED DOWN VERSION OF HIMSELF FROM OTHER MOVIES
nzpVDcQ0ywM_12	I DONT REALLY FEEL ANY EMOTIONAL PULL FROM HIM IN THIS MOVIE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_15	AND HES PRETTY AVERAGE TOO
nzpVDcQ0ywM_14	HE DOES SOME STEREOTYPICAL THINGS LIKE TALKING UH ABOUT BUSTING A CAP WHILE FLYING AN AIRPLANE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_17	AND SO THATS PRETTY ENTERTAINING
nzpVDcQ0ywM_16	THE TWO WOMEN IN THIS MOVIE ARE PARTICULARLY GOOD LOOKING
nzpVDcQ0ywM_19	AND HIS PERFORMANCE IS CAMPY AND COMES OFF AS AN ARMY CHEERLEADER SOME OF THE TIME
nzpVDcQ0ywM_18	THIS IS A REALLY BIG MOVIE FOR THEIR CAREERS BECAUSE I HAVENT REALLY SEEN THEM IN A LOT OF BIG MOVIES
ob23OKe5a9Q_11	IT WAS CUTE YOU KNOW THE ACTORS DID A GREAT JOB BRINGING THE SMURFS TO LIFE SUCH AS JOE GEORGE LOPEZ NEIL PATRICK HARRIS KATY PERRY AND A FOURTH
ob23OKe5a9Q_10	OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE
ob23OKe5a9Q_13	BUT I HAD A FEW PROBLEMS SO I DIDNT LOVE IT I LIKED IT
ob23OKe5a9Q_12	IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE AND I LOVED IT
ob23OKe5a9Q_14	THREE STARS FOR SMURFS AND STAY SMURFY EVERYONE
ob23OKe5a9Q_1	BUT IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE
ob23OKe5a9Q_3	ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS VERY PREDICTABLE VERY PREDICTABLE
ob23OKe5a9Q_2	ID GIVE IT THREE STARS
ob23OKe5a9Q_5	THAT UM I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER PROBLEM I HAD WITH IT WAS THAT UM THE JOKES WERE REALLY CHEESY
ob23OKe5a9Q_4	BUT VERY PREDICTABLE
ob23OKe5a9Q_7	SO IF THATS THE CASE THEN YOU SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU REALLY LIKE CHEESY JOKES PREDICTABLE MOVIES BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A PERFECT FAMILY MOVIE
ob23OKe5a9Q_6	I DONT LIKE CHEESY JOKES BUT CHEESY JOKES ARE MOST TIMES FUNNY CUZ THEYRE REALLY BAD
ob23OKe5a9Q_9	BEYOND THIS AGE THE PROBLEM I HAD WITH THE MOVIE THEATRE IS THERE WERE KIDS CRYING THE WHOLE TIME AND WHISPERING XXX DOES BABY CRYING GET ON YOUR NERVES EVER IF IT DOES WOULDNT RECOMMEND GOING TO THIS MOVIE CUZ THERES A BUNCH OF KIDS OR SNEAK INTO A REALLY LATE SHOWING CUZ I DONT THINK KIDS ARE GOING TO BE OUT THAT LATE BUT THATS THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WITH IT
ob23OKe5a9Q_8	I WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE 8 OR YOUNGER KIDS TO THAT MOVIE ITS A DEFINITE FAMILY MOVIE
pLTX3ipuDJI_11	ALTHOUGH WHAT IT DID DO WAS INTERESTING BUT I BUT IT DIDNT MAKE SENSE
pLTX3ipuDJI_10	BUT ITS JUST A LITTLE WEAK OVERALL FOR ME THAN WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO HIM AND HE WAS GONE QUICKLY
pLTX3ipuDJI_13	JUST LIKE ONE OF THE GIRLS TELLS THE EXACT STORY OF THE FIRST MOVIE
pLTX3ipuDJI_12	HE CO LAURENCE FISHBURNE COMES IN AND TELLS THE CHARACTERS THINGS THAT ONLY SCREEN WRITERS SHOULDVE KNOWN ABOUT WHICH GIVES A LITTLE MORE OF F FONY FEEL THIS WHOLE THING
pLTX3ipuDJI_15	IT DOSENT GIVE AN GIVE ANY INSIGHT OR HELP ITS JUST MAKE THEM SEEM LIKE SHE SA SHE SAW THE FIRST MOVIE
pLTX3ipuDJI_14	ITS A POINTLESS SCENE FOR THE AUDIENCE AND THE CHARACTERS
pLTX3ipuDJI_16	IN FINALE I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR A RENTAL NON IN THEATER BECAUSE ITS A LOW GRADE SEQUAL TO THE 87TH VERSION AND ONLY IF YOU LIKE THE SERIES
pLTX3ipuDJI_1	NOTHING NEW IS BROUGHT IN THOSE PREDATOR SERIES NO SURPRISES NO BIG TWIST NO FINISH
pLTX3ipuDJI_3	ALTHOUGHT WHAT WASNT THE SAME WAS THE CONNECTION TO EACH OTHER WHICH FIRST MOVIE HAD AND THIS ONE NOT
pLTX3ipuDJI_2	I LIKE TO TEASE SOME MYSTERY AND GREAT PLOT WHAT COULDVE BEEN BUT THAN ALL IS EXPLAINED AND DISPPEARES TEN MINUTES LATER ITS JUST A CLEAR REMAKE OF PREDATOR FROM BACK IN 1997 WITH THE PREMISE BEING ALMOST IDENTICAL
pLTX3ipuDJI_5	YOU DONT SEE ANY OF THE PERSONALITIES WHEN ONE DIES YOU DONT MOURN OVER THAM AN YOU DONT GET AN ATTACHMENT TO ANYBODY
pLTX3ipuDJI_4	IN THE FIRST RUN THEY WERE A TEAM AND THEY WORKED TOGETHER AND YOU SEE THE PERSONALITES THIS MOVIE JUST POPS A GROUP OF DIFFERENT KILLERS DOWN TOGETHER AND LETS THEM INTERACT POORLY
pLTX3ipuDJI_7	BUT NOTHING SUCKS EITHER WHICH GAINS THE MOVIE SOME POINTS I GUESS
pLTX3ipuDJI_6	OF THE ACTING NOTHING STANDS OUT A SPECTACULAR WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED OF THE MOVIE LIKE THIS
pLTX3ipuDJI_9	AND I KNOW YOU CANT HYPE A MOVIE WITH AN UNKNOWN ACTORS SO EVEN IF SOMEONE IS IN THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU SHOULD HYPE THEM
pLTX3ipuDJI_8	WHAT DISAPPOINTED ME WAS THAT ONE OF THE MOST HYPED ACTORS IN THE MOVIE WAS ONLY IN THERE FOR SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
phBUpBr1hSo_11	I LOVE MY MOVIES TO BE LONG
phBUpBr1hSo_10	THIS MOVIE SEEMED UM A LITTLE LONG
phBUpBr1hSo_13	UM IM PASSIONATE ABOUT MOVIES SO THATS FINE
phBUpBr1hSo_12	I DONT THINK A MOVIE CAN EVER BE TOO LONG UM YOU KNOW I LIKE YOU KNOW THE DARK NIGHT WAS YOU KNOW TWO HOURS AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES YOU KNOW AND TITANIC YOU KNOW ALL THOSE MOVIES A AVATAR ALL THOSE MOVIES THAT YOU KNOW THREE HOURS AND YOU KNOW THATS FINE BY ME I LOVE LONG MOVIES
phBUpBr1hSo_15	SOME PARTS JUST KIND OF DRAGGED ON YOU KIND OF YOU KNOW SIT IN THE MOVIE THEATER AND THIS IS A BIG ACTION MOVIE ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVIES OF THE SUMMER AND YOU KIND OF JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW REST YOUR HEAD WHILE WATCHED UM COZ SOME OF THE SEQUENCES AND SOME OF THE SCENES WERE JUST KIND OF LONG
phBUpBr1hSo_14	BUT THIS ONE SEEMED LONG AT SOME AT SOME PARTS
phBUpBr1hSo_17	UM THE ACTION WAS GREAT YOU KNOW NOT TOO MUCH NOT TOO LITTLE JUST UM JUST ENOUGH ACTION
phBUpBr1hSo_16	AND YOU JUST KIND OF LIKE OK LETS GET TO IT WE KNOW WHATS GONNA HAPPEN LETS GO AHEAD AND DO IT
phBUpBr1hSo_19	BUT PRETTY GOOD SCRIPT
phBUpBr1hSo_18	UM THE STORY WAS ALL RIGHT
phBUpBr1hSo_20	I DONT THINK IT WAS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE OBVIOUSLY I I THINK THE FIRST MOVIE WAS JUST FANTASTIC
phBUpBr1hSo_1	I WENT TO THIS MOVIE VERY VERY EXCITED
phBUpBr1hSo_3	I THINK UM THE MOVIES ARE PHENOMENAL ESPECIALLY THAT FIRST ONE
phBUpBr1hSo_2	IM A BIG TRANSFORMERS FAN
phBUpBr1hSo_5	UM IN INTERVIEWS SHIA LABEOUF SAID THAT THE SECOND MOVIE LACKED UM HEART
phBUpBr1hSo_4	UM I DONT THINK THAT THIS OVE GOT AS MUCH BUZZ AND AS MUCH UM MEDIA ATTENTION AND UM WORD OF MOUTH YOU KNOW SPREADING AROUND AND STUFF
phBUpBr1hSo_7	UM AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE I DONT REALLY THINK THATS NECESSARILY TRUE UM I THINK THAT THE SECOND MOVIE AND THE THIRD MOVIE ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR UM I THINK THEY TRIED TO ADD A LOT OF HEART
phBUpBr1hSo_6	AND HE SAID THAT THIS NEW ONE HAS A LOT OF HEART UM SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE

phBUpBr1hSo_21	UM MAYBE IM PART WITH THE SECOND ONE MAYBE IM LITTLE BEHIND THAT BUT IT WAS IT WAS PRETTY GOOD STORY
rnaNMUZpvvg_20	HE LOOKED AWESOME WHILE HE DID IT BUT YEAH OK SO LET ALL THE GIRLS WHO WANT ALL DISAGREE WITH ME COZ THEY ALL THINK THIS IS AN AMAZING MOVIE BUT THEY ALL THINK HE WAS AMAZING BECAUSE THEY WERE STARING AT DANIEL CRAIG THE WHOLE TIME THEYR GOING OH MY GOSH HES SO HOT
rnaNMUZpvvg_21	ALL THE GUYS THAT WENT WERE PRETTY MUCH ON MY PAGE THEY WERE JUST LIKE WOW THAT WAS STUPID WOW
rnaNMUZpvvg_22	I SAT WITH THE GUYS AND WE ALL TRY TO STAY AWAKE THROUGH IT UM AND KEPT FALLING ASLEEP AND THEN TALK ABOUT HOW STUPID IT WAS
rnaNMUZpvvg_1	THE VERDICT IS STUPID AND A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY
rnaNMUZpvvg_3	LIKE I DIDNT EXPECT IT TO BE GOOD
rnaNMUZpvvg_2	BUT IT WAS A FUN EXPERIENCE GOING
rnaNMUZpvvg_5	AAAAA IT WASNT EVEN HOLDING MY ATTENTION
rnaNMUZpvvg_4	BUT ITS JUST SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY FOR THEM LIKE WHEN I SEE THE MOVIE THATS OBVIOUSLY HAD A VERY BIG BUDGET AND IT IS LIKE NOT EVEN GOOD IT MAKES ME ANGRY COZ IM JUST LIKE WHY ARE YOU WASTING SO MUCH MONEY
rnaNMUZpvvg_7	I HONESTLY WANTED THE ALIENS TO WIN
rnaNMUZpvvg_6	I COULD BARELY STAY AWAKE THROUGH THE MOVIE
rnaNMUZpvvg_9	JUST THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHARACTER THE DOCTOR HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON I EVEN REALLY CARED ABOUT
rnaNMUZpvvg_8	ALL THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST SO UNLIKABLE
rnaNMUZpvvg_11	EVERY SINGLE COWBOY WAS JUST A COMPLETE DOUCHEBAG
rnaNMUZpvvg_10	AND EVEN HE WAS A DOUCHEBAG ALL OF THEM
rnaNMUZpvvg_13	BUT HE WASNT EVEN INTERESTING
rnaNMUZpvvg_12	AND THERE WAS JUST THIS LITTLE BOY AND HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO WASNT A DOUCHEBAG
rnaNMUZpvvg_15	HE WAS JUST LIKE A PLOT DEVICE FOR THIS OTHER GUY TO START ACTING LIKE A FATHER FIGURE AND HE WAS JUST STUPID BUT THEN HE DIDNT EVEN ACT LIKE A FATHER FIGURE TOWARDS HIM
rnaNMUZpvvg_14	BUT THEY GAVE HIM NO NO CHARACTER LIKE HE HAD NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHATSOEVER
rnaNMUZpvvg_17	WHY ARE YOU KILLING EVERYONE
rnaNMUZpvvg_16	BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY COMPLETE DOUCHEBAG
rnaNMUZpvvg_19	WHAY ARE YOU KILLING THESE PEOPLE YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHATS GOING ON LIKE DUDE GET OVER YOURSELF
rnaNMUZpvvg_18	IT JUST SOME PEOPLE WERE LIKE OH HES SO COOL HES SO AWESOME LIKE YOUVE NEVER SEEN THAT IN THE MOVIE THIS PERSON WHO HAD AMNESIA JUST KILLS EVERYBODY EVEN IF ITS LIKE BUT THAT WAS SO UNNECESSARY
tIrG4oNLFzE_11	AND THEN MAYBE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS HAPPY LIKE SHE WOULDNT FROWN HER UM FROWN HER EYEBROWS BUT SHED STILL BE POUTY BUT LIKE YEAH LIKE THAT
tIrG4oNLFzE_10	IT WAS LIKE THIS LIKE POUTY LIKE GRUMPY LOOK
tIrG4oNLFzE_13	LIKE THOSE THO THOSE THOSE MOMENTS IN THE FILM ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING WHERE SHE WOULD SIT THERE STAND THERE CROSS UM WITH HER ARMS CROSSED AND JUST LOOK OUT INTO THE DISTANCE LIKE JUST LAUGHING WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION OR SHED LOOK ACROSS THE BEACH OR SHED LOOK AT HER DAD OR SHED LOOK AT HER BROTHER WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION AND I WAS JUST LIKE WHATRE YOU THINKING I I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CHARACTERS DOING
tIrG4oNLFzE_12	WHICH JUST UH IT REALLY ANNOYED ME
tIrG4oNLFzE_15	BUT AS AN ACTOR I REALLY THINK ESPECIALLY AN ACTOR IN THE LEAD LEADING ROLE YOU REALLY SHOULD PREPARE FOR THAT ROLE
tIrG4oNLFzE_14	LIKE OKAY SHES STARING WHATS SHE THINKING HOW DOES SHE FEEL I HAD NO IDEA LIKE IT WAS THE SAME EXPRESSION FOR SHOCK OR FOR SADNESS OR WHAT I PRESUMED SHED BE SAD BUT IT SIGH IT REALLY BUGGED ME
tIrG4oNLFzE_17	SMACKING SO THATS PROBABLY WHY SHE JUST LAUGHINGLOOKED THE SAME IN EVERY SINGLE SCENE THERE WAS PROBABLY ABOUT TWO SCENES THAT I ACTUALLY THOUGHT YEA SHE THIS IS HER ACTING THIS IS GOOD SHE CAN DO THIS
tIrG4oNLFzE_16	I WAS LIKE HOW CAN YOU GO INTO A FILM INTO A LEADING ROLE AND HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOUR CHARACTER IS
tIrG4oNLFzE_18	BUT THEN THOSE TWO MOMENTS JUST GOT RUINED BY THE REST OF AN HOUR AND A HALF OF HER BEING POUTY
tIrG4oNLFzE_1	NOW I AM A HUGE HUGE FAN OF NICHOLAS SPARKS
tIrG4oNLFzE_3	UM I REALLY ENJOYED A WALK TO REMEMBER ME AND DEAR JOHN
tIrG4oNLFzE_2	UM THE NOTEBOOK IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS
tIrG4oNLFzE_5	SO I WENT INTO THIS FILM HAVING QUITE HIGH EXPECTATIONS
tIrG4oNLFzE_4	I REALLY DID ENJOY AS WELL WASNT TOO FOND OF THE ENDING
tIrG4oNLFzE_7	BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I WAS REALLY UM WARY OF GOING
tIrG4oNLFzE_6	I MEAN ITS A NICHOLAS SPARKS BOOK IT MUST BE GOOD
tIrG4oNLFzE_9	STRAIGHT AWAY MILEY CYRUS ACTING MILEY CYRUS ACTING OR LACK OF SHE HAD THIS SAME EXPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM
tIrG4oNLFzE_8	LIKE WHAT TO EXPECT FROM MILEY CYRUS UM I MEAN SHES ONLY DONE THE HANNAH MONTANA FRANCHISE PLAYING THAT ONE CHARACTER WHICH I THINK LIKE 99 OF THE PERCENT OF THE TIME HER CHARACTERS LIKE SO OVERBOARD SHES SO EXAGGERATED SO I REALLY DIDNT KNOW HOW SHE WAS GOING TO HANDLE THIS FILM
tStelxIAHjw_11	I JUST HATED IT
tStelxIAHjw_10	I DIDNT THINK IT WAS SAD
tStelxIAHjw_13	TWO OUT OF FIVE STARS
tStelxIAHjw_12	LIKE SERIOUSLY

tStelxIAHjw_3	I REALLY DID
tStelxIAHjw_2	UM I THINK THE LAST MOVIE I SAW IN THEATRES WAS TOY STORY 3 AND I HATED IT
tStelxIAHjw_5	AND I REALLY HATED CARS
tStelxIAHjw_4	I THINK IM GETTING TO THAT POINT WHERE IM JUST NOT ENTERTAINED BY DISNEY PIXAR MOVIES ANYMORE BECAUSE I COULDNT STAND UP
tStelxIAHjw_7	AND I LIKED WALLY
tStelxIAHjw_6	I LIKED FINDING NEMO
tStelxIAHjw_9	I DIDNT THINK IT WAS CUTE
tStelxIAHjw_8	I DIDNT THINK IT WAS FUNNY
tmZoasNr4rU_11	AND UH ALTHOUGH LIKE I LIKE DARK HUMOR
tmZoasNr4rU_10	SMACKING LIPS MAYBE ONLY 5 JOKES MADE ME LAUGH
tmZoasNr4rU_13	NO I I I GUESS SO I MEAN ITS ITS IT WASNT ANNOYING
tmZoasNr4rU_12	BUT I JUST COULDNT FIND IT FUNNY
tmZoasNr4rU_15	MAYBE A LOT MORE THAN THE EXPENDABLES
tmZoasNr4rU_14	IT IT IT WAS JUST THERE I I I I WASNT I WASNT AMUSED
tmZoasNr4rU_17	THE ACTION FEELS THAT ITS UM IT ITS ITS PRETTY MUCH JUST UH QUICK CUT OR SLASH BLOOD SCREAM YOU KNOW LIP SMACKING
tmZoasNr4rU_16	BUT I FEEL THAT THE MOVIE WASNT REALLY CONCERNED WITH BEING EXCITING
tmZoasNr4rU_19	STILL THE THE CHURCH SHOOTOUT HOWEVER BRIEF THAT WAS IT IT WAS ALRIGHT
tmZoasNr4rU_18	FFFFLAT SHIT LIP SMACKING
tmZoasNr4rU_20	MAYBE IT COULD HAVE BEEN 20 SECONDS LONGER
tmZoasNr4rU_1	UM ID LIKE TO QUICKLY TALK ABOUT MACHETE
tmZoasNr4rU_3	I COULDNT GET INTO IT
tmZoasNr4rU_2	IM SORRY AND DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THIS I DIDNT LIKE IT
tmZoasNr4rU_5	AND MAYBE PLANET TERROR IM IM NOT SURE IM JUST
tmZoasNr4rU_4	I KNOW IT ITS NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY MAYBE 70S EXPLOITATION MOVIES ARE MORE CHEESY THAN MACHETE
tmZoasNr4rU_7	I I CANT EXPLAIN WHY THE HUMOR WAS WAS MOSTLY FLAT BECAUSE A FEW OR SEVERAL JOKES ACTUALLY FELT THEY THEY THEY ACTUALLY FELT FELT FUNNY
tmZoasNr4rU_6	SOUND OF CARS THE ACTION AND HUMOR WERE MOSTLY FLAT
tmZoasNr4rU_9	SIGH IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HELPED IF I WENT WITH WITH SOMEONE IF AT LEAST ONE OTHER ONE OTHER PERSON WENT WITH ME
tmZoasNr4rU_8	BUT BUT I JUST DID DIDNT LAUGH
v0zCBqDeKcE_11	AND JIM CARRY UM I KIND OF LIGHT WENT OFF I LOVE UM I USED TO IMMITATE HIS COMEDY STYLE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BELIEVE IT OR NOT

v0zCBqDeKcE_4	UM I SHOULDNT SAY LIKE ITS NOT LIKE AMAZINGLY GONNA WIN SOME AWARDS GOOD
v0zCBqDeKcE_7	I MEAN SOME PEOPLE LIKE JAMES WOODS I BELIEVE HIS IQ IS 1 180 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
v0zCBqDeKcE_6	NOW THE REAL STEVEN RUSSEL HAS LIKE AN IQ LIKE 163 WHICH IS LIKE WOW GENIOUS
v0zCBqDeKcE_9	I THINK THEY ARE VERY GOOD ACTORS
v0zCBqDeKcE_8	JIM CARRY IAN MCGREGGOR I LIKED THE TWO OF THEM
vvZ4IcEtiZc_11	BECAUSE ITS UM ITS AN AUDIENCE PLEASER YOU KNOW
vvZ4IcEtiZc_10	AND ITS SORT OF LIKE A CONTRIVED PLOT THATS BEEN USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
vvZ4IcEtiZc_12	AN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ROMANTIC DRAMAS LIKE THUMPING ITS UH IT GETS THE AUDIENCES TO THEATRES BECAUSE ITS A COMPELLING IDEA BUT ITS BEEN UH DONE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_1	AND I REALLY REALLY LOVED IT
vvZ4IcEtiZc_3	AND I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT UM HOW ITS THE PERFORMANCES IN IT WERE SORT OF OVER OVERLOOKED AT THE ACADEMY AWARDS
vvZ4IcEtiZc_2	AND I THOUGHT THAT THE PERFORMANCES IN IT WERE INCREDIBLE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_5	BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF GREAT MOVIES OUT THIS YEAR
vvZ4IcEtiZc_4	BECAUSE UM THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT MOVIES THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR I MEAN UM THE KINGS SPEECH BLACK SWAN 127 HOURS INCEPTION
vvZ4IcEtiZc_7	AND I THINK THAT BLUE VALENTINE HAS UM BECOME KIND OF UNDERRATED
vvZ4IcEtiZc_6	SOME OF THE GREAT PERFORMANCES UM OF LAST YEAR WERE KIND OF OVERLOOKED CUZ THERE WERE JUST SO MANY OF THEM
vvZ4IcEtiZc_9	AND THERES A LOTS OF SMACKING LIPS THERES SO MANY DYNAMICS GOING ON WITH THIS RELATIONSHIP AND I THINK THAT IT WAS IT WAS A GREAT STORY
vvZ4IcEtiZc_8	AND ITS TRULY HEARTBREAKING TO SEE THAT CONTRASTED WITH THE STATE OF THINGS
vyB00TXsimI_20	AND I ENJOYED MYSELF A LOT AT THE MOVIE
vyB00TXsimI_21	I LAUGHED AT QUITE A BIT OF THE DIALOGUE
vyB00TXsimI_22	AND THERE ACTUALLY WAS ONE SCENE THAT I FOUND KIN
vyB00TXsimI_1	BUT I DO WANNA TELL YOU ABOUT PRIEST
vyB00TXsimI_3	IF YOU LIKE EXPLOSIONS REALLY RIDICULOUS ACTION SEQUENCES MALODRAMATIC PLOT AND ACTING THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVIE TO SEE
vyB00TXsimI_2	IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE THAT HAS ANYTHING REALISTIC IN IT YOU SHOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS INSANE
vyB00TXsimI_5	AND IS FUN TO WATCH
vyB00TXsimI_4	AND SHE ALSO HAS PRETTY SWEET MOVES
vyB00TXsimI_7	THERERE ALSO TWO LORD OF THE RINGS GRADS WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE
vyB00TXsimI_6	SOME REALLY FUN TOUCHES WITHIN THE MOVIE IS THAT TWO VAMPIRES IN OTHER SHOWS APPEAR IN THIS MOVIE NOT AS VAMPIRES
vyB00TXsimI_9	IF ALL THREE OF THEM WERE PUT TOGETHER
vyB00TXsimI_8	AND ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER
vyB00TXsimI_11	WHICH BASICALLY MEANS HES WORMTONGUE AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT WAY
vyB00TXsimI_10	YEAH THATS ABOUT HOW MY FAVORITE LIST GOES
vyB00TXsimI_13	AND SHE IS A REALLY PRETTY GIRL
vyB00TXsimI_12	OTHER NOTABLE MENTIONES ARE CHRISTOPHER PLUMBER
vyB00TXsimI_15	I REALLY LOVE THE MELODRAMATIC OVER THE TOP CRAZY ACTION SORT OF THING GOING ON
vyB00TXsimI_14	THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TYPES OF MOVIES
vyB00TXsimI_17	AND THERES A BETTER ON TOP OF THE TRAIN FIGHTS THAN THE FIRST MISSION IMPOSSIBLE MOVIE
vyB00TXsimI_16	THERES S SCENE IN A CAVE WHERE THEY FIGHT A GIANT MONSTER THAT REALLY REMINDS ME OF LIKE SOME SORT OF LORD OF THE RINGS MINES OF MORIA MOMENT
vyB00TXsimI_19	I THOUGHT IT WAS FUN
vyB00TXsimI_18	SO YES I REALLY ENJOYED IT
wMbj6ajWbic_24	MARLON WAYANS HAD A LOT OF FUN
wMbj6ajWbic_25	BUT THE GUY FROM LOST HAD A LOT OF FUN
wMbj6ajWbic_26	DENNIS QUAID I THINK HAD A LOT OF FUN
wMbj6ajWbic_27	UM SAME WITH CHRISTOPHER ECCLESTON
wMbj6ajWbic_20	UM AND NOW THE PERFORMANCES ARE LIKE SOMETHING LIKE TO WRITE HOME ABOUT
wMbj6ajWbic_21	UM THAT BEING SAID YOU CAN TELL THAT LOT PEOPLE WERE HAVING FUN WITH THIS
wMbj6ajWbic_22	AND I XXX LIKE IN PARTICULAR JOSEPH JOSEPH GORDONLEVITT HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH HIS ROLE
wMbj6ajWbic_23	I THINK UM RACHEL NICHOLS HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH HER ROLE
wMbj6ajWbic_28	SO I I THINK IT WAS COOL TO ACTUALLY SEE RAY PARK IN ACTION GREAT ACTION STAR
wMbj6ajWbic_29	HE DOES A GREAT JOB WITH HIS SNAKE EYES WHICH IS ALWAYS COOL TO SEE THAT
wMbj6ajWbic_1	BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO SEE IT ACTUALLY
wMbj6ajWbic_3	OR BIG COLLECTOR OF THE ACTION FIGURES
wMbj6ajWbic_2	AND UM FIRST OF ALL I I ACTUALLY WAS NEVER A HUGE FAN OF THE JI JOE TV SERIES
wMbj6ajWbic_5	JI JOE RISE OF THE COBRA UM THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE CHEEZY
wMbj6ajWbic_4	BUT I WASNT BIG ON IT UM
wMbj6ajWbic_7	YES IT THE ACTING IS A LITTLE ROUGH IN SOME PARTS
wMbj6ajWbic_6	BUT IN THE GOOD WAY I IN IST THERES TWO TYPES OF CHEEZY AND THIS IS THE GOOD KIND OF CHEEZY
wMbj6ajWbic_9	BUT THE M THE SCRIPT IS CORNY
wMbj6ajWbic_8	WELL YOU KNOW UM CORNY
wMbj6ajWbic_11	I MEAN I DIDNT GO TO THIS MOVIE EXPECTING TO SEE THE DARK NIGHT
wMbj6ajWbic_10	I MEAN THE WAY ITS WRITTEN IS CORNY
wMbj6ajWbic_13	BECAUSE IF IVE SEEN IT OVER THE SUMMER I PROBABLY WOULDVE RATED IT BEST ACTION MOVIE I SAW THIS SUMMER
wMbj6ajWbic_12	AND QUITE HONESTLY I WISH IVE SEEN THIS OVER THE SUMMER
wMbj6ajWbic_15	I DID LIKE TRANSFORMERS 2 EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDNT LIKE THAT
wMbj6ajWbic_14	THIS SUMMER WAS KIND OF WEIRD WITH THE ACTION MOVIES IF YOU ASK ME
wMbj6ajWbic_17	AND UM YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS
wMbj6ajWbic_16	BUT YOU KNOW THIS MOVIE UM THIS REALLY UM WOULDVE MADE UP FOR A DISAPPOINTMENT THAT IT HAD A TERMINATOR SALVATION
wMbj6ajWbic_19	SO YOU KNOW ITS NOT LIKE YOU ACTUALLY GETTING LIKE ACADEMY AWARD QUALITY ACTING PERFORMANCES
wMbj6ajWbic_18	IN YOU KNOW THEYRE IN THERE THIS IS A CHEEZY UM MOVIE
wMbj6ajWbic_30	JOE MOVIE IS HOW INTERNATIONAL IT WAS IT WAS VERY DIVERT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_24	I WOULD NOT TAKE A YOUNG CHILD
yDtzw_Y-7RU_20	EXCEPT THEIR EYES ARE KIND OF LIKE THIS WELCOME TO THE POLAR EXPRESS
yDtzw_Y-7RU_21	AND THATS A LOT TO BE SAID FOR A ONE MINUTE REVIEW
yDtzw_Y-7RU_22	I ACTUALLY LIKE THE FILM
yDtzw_Y-7RU_23	UM I ENJOYED MYSELF IN IT YOU MIGHT AS WELL
yDtzw_Y-7RU_1	BUT LET ME FIRST SAY THIS I LIKED IT MORE THAN I EXPECTED I WOULD
yDtzw_Y-7RU_3	NUMBER ONE IT MEANS ITS MUCH SCARIER THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE
yDtzw_Y-7RU_2	THIS FILM IS SLAVISHLY DEVOTED TO THE ORIGINAL BOOK OR NOV NOVELLA UH BY UH CHARLES DICKENS
yDtzw_Y-7RU_5	LET ME SAY THIS IF YOUR CHRISTIANITY IS EXTREMELY LEGALISTIC THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU
yDtzw_Y-7RU_4	MY 8 YEAR OLD WAS TERRIFIED THROUGH PART OF THIS BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL VERSION IS TERRIFYING
yDtzw_Y-7RU_7	SO LAUGHING IF THATS YOUR FORM OF CHRISTIANITY ITS A CHRISTIAN FILM
yDtzw_Y-7RU_6	CAUSE THIS IS A FILM THAT BASICALLY SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE JESUS TOLD US TO TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE AND IF YOU DONT TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE YOURE GONNA BURN IN HELL
yDtzw_Y-7RU_9	UM ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS IN ITS DEVOTION IS THAT SOMETIMES MY CHILDREN COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS BEING SAID BECAUSE THEY WERE SPEAKING DICKENSONIAN ENGLISH
yDtzw_Y-7RU_8	UM ITS NOT MY FORM
yDtzw_Y-7RU_11	THEREFORE A LOT OF SOCIAL COMMENTARY GOES WOOP SOUND EFFECT OVER YOUR HEAD
yDtzw_Y-7RU_10	SOMETIMES I MISSED WHAT WAS BEING SAID
yDtzw_Y-7RU_13	UM ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT DEBTORS PRISON FOR INSTANCE DOESNT REALLY UM JIVE HERE IN 21ST CENTURY AMERICA
yDtzw_Y-7RU_12	OR JUST REALLY DOESNT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO US TODAY AT ALL
yDtzw_Y-7RU_15	BECAUSE THIS THING IS IS MEANT TO BE SEEN IN 3D
yDtzw_Y-7RU_14	AND THIS FILM IS THIS AMAZING LIKE I SAY SLAVISH DEVOTION TO CHARLES DICKENS WITH AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE
yDtzw_Y-7RU_17	OR MOST LIKELY FROM GOING VERY QUICKLY THROUGH LONDON WITH YOU KNOW DEMON HORSES CHASING YOU SO UH THERES THAT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_16	AND THROUGHOUT THE FILM YOURE GOING SOUND EFFECTS LAUGHING EITHER FROM THE TERRIFYING CHARACTERS
yDtzw_Y-7RU_19	UM THE PEOPLE SEEMED SORT OF DEAD
yDtzw_Y-7RU_18	ALSO ABOUT THE ANIMATION THE PEOPLE JUST LIKE IN POLAR EXPRESS A FILM I REALLY DID NOT LIKE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_20	I CAN APPRECIATE THAT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_21	HES NOT GONNA BE LOOKING LIKE A CHIPPER BRIGHT YOUNG MAN BUT EARLY THIRTIES REALLY YOU WANT ME TO BUY THAT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_22	I CANT DO IT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_23	ESPECIALLY WHEN HES HANGING AROUND WITH A MARRIED MEN WHO ALL BUT ONE OF THEM ARE PROBABLY EARLY TWENTIES LAUGHTER AND ONE OF THEM IS MAYBE MID TWENTIES AND MEANWHILE THEYRE HANGING IN WITH PAPA RUSSEL IT JUST LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW ITS BUNCH OF A GUYS HANGING THERE SO ONE BROUGHT DAD ALONG COZ HE OFFERED TO DRIVE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_1	ROBIN HOOD STARRING RUSSEL CROW UM FIRST THING I GOT TO SAY XXX I WAS DREADING GOING IN TO SEE THIS MOVIE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_3	SO I REALLY WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THIS MOVIE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_2	THE TRAILERS WERENT REALLY DOING IT MUCH FOR ME
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_5	BUT I DIDNT MIND IT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_4	UM BUT I GUESS SAY MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE LOWERED BY THESE OTHER REVIEWS THAT I READ
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_7	I DIDNT FIND IT ALL THAT GOOD
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_6	BUT I DIDNT FIND IT ALL THAT BAD
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_9	LIKE WHAT PEOPLE COULD HATE ABOUT THIS MOVIE THERE ARE SOME NEGATIVES TO SAY THE LEAST
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_8	LIKE I SAID MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE LOWERED BECAUSE OF ALL OF THOSE REVIEWS BUT I REALLY DIDNT HATE IT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_11	THERES MEN IN TIGHTS WHICH YOU KNOW HILARIOUS SPOOF OF THE STORY
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_10	UM REALLY FIRST AND FOREMOST IT JUST LACKED THE CHARM OF THESE PAST ROBIN HOOD MOVIES THAT WE KNOW
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_13	AND IT JUST LACKED THE CHARM OF THOSE PAST MOVIES
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_12	THERES A KEVIN COSTNER PRINCE OF FEE VERSION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DARK AND EDGY VERSION OF HIS TIME I MEAN BUT THAT WAS WHAT THIRTEEN YEARS AGO FOURTEEN YEARS AGO PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_15	AND IT REALLY JUST LACKED WHAT MADE THE OTHER MOVIES MORE ENJOYABLE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_14	IT DID SEEM TO FOCUS TOO MUCH ON EPIC EPIC EPIC
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_17	UM NOT IN ALL INSTANCES BUT THE ONES THAT MATTER THE MOST YEAH
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_16	AND SUFFERS FROM WHAT I CALL KINGDOM OF HEAVEN SYNDROM WHERE IT BUILDS TOO MUCH FOR THESE HUGE CATASTROPHIC WAR SEQUENCES THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BLOW YOU AWAY BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU DONT GIVE A DAMN BECAUSE IT JUST LACKS THAT CHARM OF THE PAST MOVIES
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_19	LIKE WERE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO ARE IN THEIR MID WEL YOU KNOW MID THIRTIES AT THE OLDEST AND LAUGHTER THEYRE LOOKING PRETTY ROUGH IN THIS MOVIE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_18	UM RUSSEL CROW AND CATE BLANCHETTE JUST DID NOT SELL IT FOR ME I HAD A VERY HARD TIME JUST BUYING IT
zhpQhgha_KU_24	AND NOT BEING REALLY STRESSED OUT
zhpQhgha_KU_25	AND I THINK THAT THATS THATS A VERY RELATABLE ISSUE
zhpQhgha_KU_26	I THINK THAT THEY ALL HAVE LIKE A LOT OF ISSUES
zhpQhgha_KU_27	AND THAT SOME ARE VERY RELATABLE
zhpQhgha_KU_20	SHE DOES HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES
zhpQhgha_KU_21	AND YOU REALLY CAN KIND OF SYMPHATIZE WHETHER YOUVE GOT TO HAVE KIDS
zhpQhgha_KU_22	I MEAN EVEN IF YOU DONT HAVE KIDS
zhpQhgha_KU_23	BECAUSE ITS JUST JUST ABOUT GETTING GETTING TIME FOR YOURSELF
zhpQhgha_KU_28	YEAH I MEAN IT IT HAS SOME FUN MOMENTS
zhpQhgha_KU_29	BUT ALL IN ALL WASNT REALLY THAT BIG OF A FAN
zhpQhgha_KU_1	IM GONNA START OFF WITH SAYING THAT I REALLY WASNT VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE MOVIE
zhpQhgha_KU_3	BUT THIS MOVIE KIND OF CAME OFF LIKE SOMEBODYS REALLY SAD TRAVEL VIDEO I DONT KNOW
zhpQhgha_KU_2	AND I LIKED THE FIRST MOVIE I THOUGHT THE FIRST MOVIE WAS REALLY GOOD
zhpQhgha_KU_5	BUT I JUST WASNT I JUST I DONT KNOW I DIDNT REALLY LIKE THE MOVIE ALL THAT MUCH
zhpQhgha_KU_4	I MEAN THAT SOUNDS REALLY HARSH
zhpQhgha_KU_7	AND A FEW FUNNY PARTS
zhpQhgha_KU_6	I MEAN I HAD SOME SOME GOOD MOMENTS
zhpQhgha_KU_9	I DONT KNOW I JUST THOUGHT I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY REALLY SAD
zhpQhgha_KU_8	BUT ALL IN ALL I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY OVER OVERLY SAD
zhpQhgha_KU_11	I JUST PERSONALLY I JUST DIDNT REALLY ENJOY IT
zhpQhgha_KU_10	UM I MEAN IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE SHOW AND YOU REALLY LIKED THE FIRST MOVIE AND YOU STILL WANNA GO AND SEE THIS IM NOT GONNA DISCOURAGE YOU FROM SEEING IT
zhpQhgha_KU_13	LIKE IT COULDVE BEEN SHORTER
zhpQhgha_KU_12	UM IT ALSO REALLY DIDNT NEED A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT IT HAD IN IT
zhpQhgha_KU_15	AND I MEAN I DONT KNOW I JUST I FEEL LIKE I DONT MEAN IF I HAVE WASTED THOSE TWO HOURS I JUST FEEL LIKE I COULDVE DONE SOMETHING BETTER WITH THEM
zhpQhgha_KU_14	BUT A LOT OF THE FOOTAGE WAS KIND OF UNNECESSARY
zhpQhgha_KU_17	I REALLY THINK THAT I REALLY LIKE THE MIRANDAS CHARACTER
zhpQhgha_KU_16	I THINK THAT CHARLOTTE AND MIRANDA HAVE SOME REALLY NICE MOMENTS IN THE MOVIE
zhpQhgha_KU_19	I THINK THAT UM AND THAT EVERYBODY I DO FEEL REALLY BAD FOR CHARLOTTE
zhpQhgha_KU_18	ACTUALLY THE MOST UPBEAT CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE MOVIE
zhpQhgha_KU_31	UM LIKE I SAID IF YOU LIKE IT FEEL FREE TO GO SEE IT I JUST PERSONALLY WASNT THAT INTO IT
zhpQhgha_KU_30	BECAUSE THERE REALLY WASNT ALL THAT MUCH TO IT FOR ME
zhpQhgha_KU_35	UM SO IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR A UM LIKE MORE POSITIVE REVIEW CHECK OUT HER REVIEW IT IS VERY GOOD
zhpQhgha_KU_34	AND SHE REALLY ENJOYED THE FILM
zhpQhgha_KU_33	IF YOU DO WANNA SEE SOMEBODY WHOS POSSIBLY CRITIQUING IT
