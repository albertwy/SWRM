Iu2PFX3z_1s_3	HE TAKES GREAT ACTORS OR ACTRESSES IN THIS CASE LIKE THE OR THE RONIN AND KATE BLANCHET
5W7Z1C_fDaE_19	WHENEVER IT COMES TO YOUR TOWN DO NOT MISS IT ITS
Bfr499ggo-0_8	AND THEY KIND OF LOOKED LIKE A CROWN INVESTORS SEEKING RICH ONE OF THEM I
tmZoasNr4rU_16	I FEEL THAT THE MOVIE WASNT REALLY CONCERNED WITH BEING EXCITING

tmZoasNr4rU_8	BUT BUT I JUST DID DIDNT LAUGH
yDtzw_Y-7RU_4	MY EIGHT YEAR OLD WAS TERRIFIED THE PART OF THIS BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL VERSION IS TERRIFYING

2WGyTLYerpo_1	SAY THAT I REALLY ENJOY COWBOYS NEARLY
Oz06ZWiO20M_10	IT REALLY IS NOT TRYING TO BE A DRAMATIC FILM OR AN ACTION FILM
MLal-t_vJPM_15	SECOND THERE IS ONE MASSIVE PLOT HOLE IN THIS FILM IT IS THE SIZE OF A DRAGON ITS AS BIG AS A MOUNTAIN AND WHEN YOU SEE THE FILMS YOULL PROBABLY KNOW WHAT I MEAN
cW1FSBF59ik_4	I LOVE WHEN THEY SHOW ALL THE THE WAR SCENES ON THE AND HES BEEN IN MILITARY AND

yDtzw_Y-7RU_23	I ENJOYED MYSELF IN IT YOU MIGHT AS WELL I
03bSnISJMiM_2	THEY DID THEY DIDNT REALLY NEED TO WORK ON SHOULD BACKGROUND INFO ON WHY SHE HOSTED BY AND BE PREPARED
8OtFthrtaJM_20	OVERALL OVERALL IT HAD FAR TOO MANY PLOT HOLES AND
c7UH_rxdZv4_20	AARON KAMIN DHEAS WHOS SUPPOSED TO BE PLUCKY I GUESS ITS KIND OF USELESS
7JsX8y1ysxY_28	VERY DARK
BXuRRbG0Ugk_18	AND THE ACTION WASNT THE MOST MEMORABLE THING ABOUT ANY OF THOSE MOVIES
LSi-o-IrDMs_2	THE MOVIE ITSELF IS THE SAME OLD CRAP FROM THE SERIES
ZUXBRvtny7o_26	I WILL EVEN BE CAPPED THIS MOVIE ON BLU RAY ANYWAYS GENERALLY FOR ME EAST THREE STARS OUT OF FIVE STARS THREE SORRY THE STARS
ZUXBRvtny7o_1	NINE NINETY SCREENING LAST I AM NUMBER FOUR YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THAT
c5xsKMxpXnc_8	NUMBER ONE BUT THE LOVE IS FORCED
d6hH302o4v8_5	OR WHAT
7JsX8y1ysxY_1	GRAPHICS WERE INCREDIBLE
1iG0909rllw_26	THEN MOMENTS ONSCREEN WHISKS ME THEY WORK REALLY WELL IN THAT A LOT WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD ITS
f_pcplsH_V0_6	ACTUALLY ITS BETTER THAN SPRING TO

5W7Z1C_fDaE_23	DEFINITELY GOT SOME FUN KEVIN SMITH MOMENTS IN IT FOR YOU TO LAUGH WITH THAT YEAH
I5y0__X72p0_37	I DID LIKE KIND OF LIKE THE ACTION
8qrpnFRGt2A_21	IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A LIVE ACTION MOVIE IF YOURE GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED
I5y0__X72p0_6	AND ALL THE PEOPLE WALKING IN THE THEATER IN THE ON THE TRAILER REALLY LIKED IT SO
Nzq88NnDkEk_18	ACTUALLY THE GUY SITTING NEXT TO ME ACTUALLY WAS TAKING AN APPLE HE KEPT DOZING OFF
pLTX3ipuDJI_4	IN THE FIRST ONE THEIR TEAM AND THEY WORK TOGETHER AND YOU SEE THE PERSONALITIES THIS MOVIE JUST TOPS THE GROUP OF DIFFERENT COLORS DOWN TOGETHER AND LETS THEM INTERACT POORLY
1DmNV9C1hbY_6	I SAW NO REASON WHY THEY NEED TO BRING BACK THE VILLAIN FROM THE FIRST ONE
bvLlb-M3UXU_18	THERES ACTUALLY A SCENES TRIPLE STANDOFF WITH SYLVESTER ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER BRUCE WILLIS AND ACTUALLY THE WAY IT KIND OF FELT HOLLOW BECAUSE
atnd_PF-Lbs_2	OH OH GOD IS IS BAD
zhpQhgha_KU_35	SO IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR MORE POSITIVE REVIEW CHECK OUT HER VIEW IT IS VERY GOOD
8d-gEyoeBzc_21	THE OTHER ONES UNFORTUNATELY AND I THINK IN THE WRITING SOMEWHERE THEY GREAT JUST ONE DEVELOPED ENOUGH TO CARE ABOUT THEM AND AND INCLUDES THE TIDE FOR GRACE NOTHING IS HIS NAME INCLUDES HIS CHARACTER
BvYR0L6f2Ig_19	SHES ALSO A TERRIFIC ACTRESS
jUzDDGyPkXU_3	VERY REMINISCENT OF DISTRICT NINE IS
k5Y_838nuGo_8	AND THATS WHY I WAS NOT EXCITED ABOUT FOURTH ONE
W8NXH0Djyww_8	AND NOW WHAT I LOVED ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS LIKE THE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE
aiEXnCPZubE_13	DOESNT HAVE ANY PRESENCE OF GREATNESS THAT ALL
wMbj6ajWbic_26	QUAY I THINK HAD A LOT OF FUN
73jzhE8R1TQ_6	SELL YEAH AND IT REALLY WAS PRETTY GOOD IN MY OPINION
1iG0909rllw_2	I MEAN LETS FACE IT EVERYTHING ALMOST PIECES
etzxEpPuc6I_10	THE PLOT IS RIDICULOUS BUT NO ONE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY LIKE
tStelxIAHjw_12	LIKE SERIOUSLY
9qR7uwkblbs_1	WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL RYAN GOSLING LEATHER SHOE ENSUED PORT
9J25DZhivz8_2	THIS IS JUST TOO ADORABLE
VCslbP0mgZI_8	BUT HERES THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEM IS REALLY THE CENTRAL PROBLEM THIS MOVIE WELL MAYBE THIS WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT UP THERE WAS A COMEDIAN NAMED DAVE CHAPELLE AND DAVE CHAPELLE END ANOTHER COMEDIAN CHRIS ROCK ARE AFRICAN AMERICANS IN IN THEIR COMEDY THEY SOMETIMES TAKE ON AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE AND SO THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY MAKE FUN OF BLACK PEOPLE AND THE THING WITH DAVE CHAPELLE WITH CHRIS ROCK IS BECAUSE THEYRE BLACK THEY CAN KIND OF DO THAT IN THERES SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THATS ACCEPTABLE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_9	BUT IT WAS JUST IT WAS LIKE I DONT EVEN LIKE YOU GUYS I FELL ASLEEP AROUND THE MIDDLE OF IT AND WILL COST LIKE WHAT JUST HAPPENED
aiEXnCPZubE_5	THE AVERAGE OR FOUND THE UNINVITED AND
d6hH302o4v8_15	VERY BORING AS WELL
WKA5OygbEKI_18	I I WOULD YEAH I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_20	HE IS AVERAGE
zhpQhgha_KU_23	ITS JUST JUST ABOUT GETTING GETTING TIME FOR YOURSELF AND
6_0THN4chvY_2	BUT I BET IF YOU PUT HIM NEXT TO THE NEW FILM DO THE STEPS I WOULD BE SIMILAR ENOUGH THAT THAT YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO REALLY TELL WHAT THE DIFFERENCES
f9O3YtZ2VfI_6	I DONT NEED ANY OF THAT CRAP
cXypl4FnoZo_24	WE KIND OF WANTED TO BE LIKE THAT ITS NOT AS OBVIOUS BUT THAT WOULDVE BEEN GOOD RATE LIKE BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE THEM A REASON BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO GET MARRIED BUT THEY COULDNT BECAUSE SHE WAS GETTING READY TO GUIDE
wMbj6ajWbic_30	I JUST MOVIES HOUSE INTERNATIONAL
LSi-o-IrDMs_24	I WOULD LOVE THAT
7JsX8y1ysxY_12	CLASSIC SUPERHERO KIND OF GET AN ALL KIND OF THINGS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_22	HES PLAYING A VARIATION OF THE ICONIC MAN WITH NO NAME CHARACTERS IT WAS MADE FAMOUS BY CLINT EASTWOOD
G6GlGvlkxAQ_15	THEY NEEDED KERR FIRST OUT OF IT RIGHT AWAY
d3_k5Xpfmik_14	IT USES IT AND THIS JUST DOESNT APPLY TO THE EDDIES SEQUENCE ON ITS OWN FOR A PRIZE TO THE MEDIA AS A WHOLE IT REALLY KNOWS HOW TO USE SLOW MOTION WITHOUT MAKING A GIMMICK
vyB00TXsimI_9	IF ALL THREE OF THEM WERE PUT TOGETHER
yDtzw_Y-7RU_19	THE PEOPLE SEEM SORT OF DAD
cW1FSBF59ik_14	IM ONE OF THE ONCE AGAIN DECIDED TO TOSS ANOTHER LANDING PAGE IN THIS MOVIE
k5Y_838nuGo_22	YEAH THE FIRST ONE IT DOES HAVE KID HUMOR DEFINITELY
1iG0909rllw_30	AND THOSE REPORTING
lXPQBPVc5Cw_22	AND REALLY FUNNY ANIMATION STUFF IT WAS GREAT REALLY FUNNY
d6hH302o4v8_42	I DONT KNOW WHY I THOUGHT
jUzDDGyPkXU_21	THE ONLY ACTOR WHO CAN REALLY SELL THEIR LINES BECAUSE THEYRE NOT CARTER
ZUXBRvtny7o_30	THE ACTING USE ITS NORMAL HES NOT HES NOT A VIOLENT SELF
_dI--eQ6qVU_13	AND THE ACTION SEQUENCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE INTENSE I
vyB00TXsimI_13	SHE IS A REALLY PRETTY GIRL
I5y0__X72p0_21	AND SO THEY KIND OF EXPLAIN IT A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT REALLY
9J25DZhivz8_16	THERE IS ONE SCENE IN THIS MOVIE THAT MAKES THREE D ENTIRELY WORTH IT
VbQk4H8hgr0_18	AND THERE WAS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER
Af8D0E4ZXaw_14	GREAT ADDITIONS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_7	I HATE TO SAY THAT
Clx4VXItLTE_20	IN I WOULD GO TO THE CINEMA THEY GET TO SEE IT BECAUSE
BioHAh1qJAQ_17	AND THEN TELL THE GAMES LOOK GREAT
nbWiPyCm4g0_6	THIS IS REALLY JUST A CONTINUATION OF THE FIRST FILM
Jkswaaud0hk_13	HE I ADDED A GREAT DIMENSIONS THE MOVIE AS WELL
wMbj6ajWbic_10	IS THIS THE WAY ITS WRITTEN IN HIS FORTIES
IumbAb8q2dM_19	HE WAS UNBELIEVABLE
2iD-tVS8NPw_2	AT THE SAME TIME I DO WANT TO JUST SAY THAT I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE I
X3j2zQgwYgE_2	REALLY MISSING RIGHT BACK HUMOR AND THAT WAY THAT IS IN THE ABSTRACT MOVIE
7JsX8y1ysxY_32	SO OVERALL ITS ITS LIKE A BLEND OF YOU GOT IT ALTERNATIVE HISTORY
aiEXnCPZubE_25	SOME SORT OF GREATNESS TO SUCKER PUNCH THOUGH
phBUpBr1hSo_5	I MEAN INTERVIEWS SHAILA ABOVE SAID THAT THE SECOND MOVIE LACKED HARKS
8d-gEyoeBzc_17	BUT THE RUSSIAN GUY YOURE ASKING
phBUpBr1hSo_14	THIS ONE SEEMS LONG AT SOME AT SOME PARTS SOME
tIrG4oNLFzE_6	I MEAN THAT IT MUST BE GOOD
9qR7uwkblbs_19	BOTH LIKE FLOGGING SHOULD
d6hH302o4v8_35	LISTEN IN YOUR WAF HELP AND WE WAS AT SOME POINT
W8NXH0Djyww_29	ONE THING I DIDNT LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THE PRODUCT MAIN KERR ARE THE BAD CHARACTERS SAY IN KINDA LATE
GWuJjcEuzt8_5	SHE STILL LOOKS LIKE SHES FORTY EIGHT
cM3Yna7AavY_2	IF YOU ARE A FAN OF DISNEY IF I AM
9c67fiY0wGQ_10	PARENTS WILL FIND THEMSELVES LAST SEEN AS A FEMINIST THEIR CHILDHOOD
BioHAh1qJAQ_6	UNFORTUNATELY THE WRITERS AND I WERE NOT EXACTLY ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH
GWuJjcEuzt8_10	JOHN SAYS WONDERFUL IT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_2	YEAH JOB PRETTY WELL DONE
VbQk4H8hgr0_38	I MEAN PLAYS INTO THE STORY
fvVhgmXxadc_12	WHATS IN HER MIND WITHIN HER MIND IN A WAY ITS KIND OF LIKE INCEPTION THAT WAITS
rnaNMUZpvvg_12	AND THEN THERES THIS LITTLE BOY AND HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO WASNT A DOUCHE BAG
QN9ZIUWUXsY_9	THIS SCRIPT CAN BE HORRIBLE
f_pcplsH_V0_15	IM JUST KIND OF A NOW THIS IS GOING TO FAR
Bfr499ggo-0_4	JUST GO IN WITH LOW
8qrpnFRGt2A_17	FIRST IN THE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_15	A HORROR FILM IN THE TRUE SENSE THAT
bOL9jKpeJRs_23	I DONT THINK HE KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE THOSE EMOTIONS IN THAT DEPARTMENT
1iG0909rllw_10	SEVERAL I MEAN WAS IT WAS OKAY JUST AVERAGE
fvVhgmXxadc_8	I DONT KNOW
tStelxIAHjw_3	I REALLY DID
Jkswaaud0hk_5	A FINE LIGHTWEIGHT DATE MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_10	YEAH THAT THAT THATS THAT IS I WOULD THINK
wMbj6ajWbic_4	BIG ON IT
G-xst2euQUc_9	I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE WAS REALLY CUTE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_3	BUT THE SECOND ONE IT IS IN SOME WAYS TAKE TO THE NEXT LEVEL
QN9ZIUWUXsY_17	IT DOESNT MAKE MUCH SENSE I KNOW
BioHAh1qJAQ_21	DISCONNECTION THAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT BECAUSE
TvyZBvOMOTc_14	YOU ARE IN THERE FIGHTING IN THE MOVIE THOUGH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ITS THEIR BANTER NOT ACTUAL DISLIKE
Clx4VXItLTE_16	SHE WANTED TO GO AND THATS LIKE SAYING A LOT FOR HER BECAUSE SHE LIKES HORROR MOVIES AS MUCH AS I DO
tmZoasNr4rU_4	I KNOW ITS NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY MAYBE SEVENTIES EXPLOITATION MOVIES ARE MORE CHEESY VAN MACHETE AND
yDtzw_Y-7RU_8	ITS NOT MY FORM SO
Af8D0E4ZXaw_22	STARTS CHEWING SCENERY LIKE ITS TWO DOLLARS STEAK
dq3Nf_lMPnE_15	GIVE SHREK FOREVER AFTER DIRECTED BY MIKE MITCHELL A GRADE OF B MINUS
9J25DZhivz8_20	ITS REALLY COOL
Clx4VXItLTE_2	FIRST SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO LOVES HORROR MOVIES AND
I5y0__X72p0_17	ITS NOT POLISHED QUITE AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE
tIrG4oNLFzE_16	HELP YOU GO INTO A FILM INTO A LEADING ROLE AND HAVE NO WAY DID IT YOUR CHARACTER IS
_dI--eQ6qVU_25	AND I JUST LOVED IT
d3_k5Xpfmik_5	ZOMBIE RUN DOES A REALLY SUCCESSFUL HORROR COMEDY AS
8qrpnFRGt2A_9	THEN IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE
8d-gEyoeBzc_8	RIGHT IM GONNA POINT AND STUFF I DID LIKE THERE WAS SOME GOOD ACTION SCENES IN IT
jUzDDGyPkXU_17	THE DIALOGUE IS TERRIBLE
OtBXNcAL_lE_5	I JUST I JUST CANT STAND MOVIES WHERE ITS LIKE THE SAME PLOT IS LIKE FIFTY OTHER MILLION MOVIES
lXPQBPVc5Cw_14	BUT THE ACTUAL STORYLINE WAS JUST TERRIBLE
TvyZBvOMOTc_2	AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT
k5Y_838nuGo_14	THE OWNERS MAYBE THE BABY ORDERS REALLY BROUGHT IT DOWN
cW1FSBF59ik_22	ALTHOUGH I DO AGREE THATS A LOOK COULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO FIT THE ACTUAL C RICHARDS LIKE WITH THE RIGHT HERE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_6	NOT GOOD
etzxEpPuc6I_5	I WAS LIKE YOU KNOW THEYRE BOTH HASBRO TOYS A BOLD MOVE THAT ARE COMPOSED MAINLY FOR CHILDREN BUT
9T9Hf74oK10_19	BUT ANYWAYS THEY DID THEY DID ACT VERY WELL
G6GlGvlkxAQ_23	YOUR SOURCE FOR FOR HOUSING THE COMMENTS OF POMPOUS ARROGANT VISUAL
BXuRRbG0Ugk_14	JON FAVREAU WAS PROBABLY NOT THE GUY THAT I WOULD HIRE IF I WAS LOOKING FOR A DIRECTOR FOR AN ACTION MOVIE
7JsX8y1ysxY_24	HE WAS AWESOME
LSi-o-IrDMs_12	A POPCORN MOVIE
BI97DNYfe5I_3	WASNT IT WAS THE SAME OLD GOOFY SETH ROGAN THAT WE ALL KNOW
rnaNMUZpvvg_7	I HONESTLY ONE OF THE ALIENS TO WIN
cXypl4FnoZo_12	I THINK I SEE IT BECAUSE I ENJOYED IT NOW
zhpQhgha_KU_15	AND I MEAN I DONT KNOW I JUST I FEEL LIKE I LITERALLY HAVE WASTED THOSE TWO HOURS I JUST FEEL LIKE I COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING BETTER
nzpVDcQ0ywM_16	THE TWO WOMEN IN THIS MOVIE ARE PARTICULARLY GOOD LOOKING
d6hH302o4v8_23	AND THIS IS THE WORST BY FAR
cW1FSBF59ik_8	I LOVE THE NAME WAIT
PZ-lDQFboO8_1	I WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THE FILM
pLTX3ipuDJI_8	WHAT DISAPPOINTED ME WAS THAT ONE OF THE MOST HIGH TAXES AND THE MOVIE WAS ONLY IN IT FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
zhpQhgha_KU_3	BUT THIS MOVIE KIND OF CAME OFF LIKE SOMEBODY IS REALLY SAD TO TRAVEL VIDEO I DONT KNOW
Nzq88NnDkEk_14	IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS A KID BACK IN THE DAY BUT BUT THIS WAS A LOT SCARY THAT SCARE THEM
9T9Hf74oK10_7	THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERE ARE CRITICS OF MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES TOO THOUGHTFUL IN A WAY AND I THINK THAT WAS NEVER LET ME GO
HEsqda8_d0Q_27	I WAS GONNA HAVE TO SAY IS
bvLlb-M3UXU_14	I GOTTA GIVE CREDIT
bOL9jKpeJRs_19	REALLY RECOMMEND YOU ALL SEE THE EXPENDABLES I PREFER
d6hH302o4v8_9	HE WAS VERY ANNOYING
c5xsKMxpXnc_4	WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THE CONCEPT WAS COOL THERES
f9O3YtZ2VfI_20	DONT GET ME WRONG ITS NOT ALL BAD
9c67fiY0wGQ_3	I THINK THE MOVIE REALLY DETECTED THE LIVELINESS OF NEW YORK CITY WELL SINCE IM A NEW YORKER MYSELF
cM3Yna7AavY_14	I HATE IT HOME ON THE RANGE
6_0THN4chvY_11	I WANT TO SEE HOW THEY COULD FRAME THAT
tmZoasNr4rU_20	MAYBE IT COULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY SECONDS LONGER
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_12	THERES A KEVIN COSTNER PRINCE OF THIEVES VERSION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DARK AND EDGY VERSION OF THIS TIME BUT I MEAN THAT WAS WHAT THIRTEEN YEARS AGO FOURTEEN YEARS AGO PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT
VbQk4H8hgr0_55	I DEFINITELY SUGGEST
2iD-tVS8NPw_27	AND IT JUST KIND OF A LEAD HELP ALLEVIATE ONE OF THAT WHOLE WORRY IS ABOUT FINDING THE ULTIMATE ENEMY WITHIN THIS FIRST MOVIE AND THAT THESE THREATS IS STILL THERE POTENTIALLY SPEAKING SO
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_6	BUT WHAT REALLY THREW ME OFF WAS THE DIALOGUE VERY CHEESY DIALOGUE OR
Ci-AH39fi3Y_3	ALL OF YOU KNEW THAT OBVIOUSLY
POKffnXeBds_7	FUNNY I MEAN THE MOVIE WAS I GUESS IT IS A WASTE OF TIME THIS
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_11	OVERALL I ENJOYED IT
OQvJTdtJ2H4_11	THAT COMES DOWN IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND
Njd1F0vZSm4_3	THE FLYING SEQUENCES ARE BEAUTIFUL
OtBXNcAL_lE_16	BUT SHES IN TROUBLE YOU KNOW BECAUSE SHE DOESNT WANT TO TELL HER BEST FRIEND BOUGHT A VILLA
iiK8YX8oH1E_16	I DONT USUALLY LIKE
VCslbP0mgZI_16	AND IT HAS WAY TOO MUCH VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
9qR7uwkblbs_23	AND I WAS THINKING LIKE IF I CAN BE A MOTHER  EMMA STONE AND CHRIS CAN BE QUITE COSTLY ENERGY GREAT DIDNT REALLY HAPPEN THIS MOVIE
2WGyTLYerpo_50	THEY ARE NOTICEABLE FLAWS
W8NXH0Djyww_13	AND THE STUFF HE SAID IT WAS JUST IT WAS JUST SO FUNNY
W8NXH0Djyww_4	AND THIS TOWN WAS LIKE FROM A GOOD ALL WESTERN
k5Y_838nuGo_4	I LIKE THE FIRST TWO STRIKES QUITE A BIT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_15	I DONT HAVE THE DECENCY TO LEARN ACTING FAST
G6GlGvlkxAQ_19	YOU KNOW WHY WHAT IS THE MISSION
c7UH_rxdZv4_16	BORING
LSi-o-IrDMs_28	IT IS A GIMMICK ULTIMATELY
VbQk4H8hgr0_43	REALLY I KIND OF I SHOULD HAVE JUST WALKED UP AND LIFTED
bvLlb-M3UXU_1	AND THATS REALLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT ITS NOT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_6	A GREAT EIGHTIES MOVIE FOR THOSE YOU HAVENT SEEN IT
8OtFthrtaJM_16	YOU KNOW IT HAD SOME INTERESTING WRITING
cW1FSBF59ik_18	LEAVE YES SAY IS NAME IS A  TREMENDOUSLY AWESOME ACTOR I
yDtzw_Y-7RU_15	THIS THING IS MEANT TO BE SEEN IN THREE D WHICH
vyB00TXsimI_5	AND ITS FUN TO WATCH
0h-zjBukYpk_25	I LIKE THAT SCENE WHERE HE AT THE STORES AND THERES A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN A SHOOTING TAKE THAT WITH MY MAGICAL SO
d3_k5Xpfmik_18	ITS ALMOST LIKE A MARGIN IF TARANTINO DIRECTED IS ON THE MOVIE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_2	I THOUGHT THAT THE PERFORMANCES AND IT WERE INCREDIBLE
9T9Hf74oK10_23	ITS NOT ITS NOT LIKE A PERIOD PIECE OR ANYTHING
Ci-AH39fi3Y_16	AND IM PRETTY SURE THATS BECAUSE IT DIDNT TIE INTO THE MOVIE IT ALSO
WKA5OygbEKI_14	HE IS SUPER ENTERTAINING AS THE CHAMELEON
2WGyTLYerpo_46	SHES ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
d6hH302o4v8_19	I HAD NO IDEA WHY SALT WE
aiEXnCPZubE_9	AND IT IS UPSTAGED BY MANY OTHER PERFORMANCES IN THE FILM
VCslbP0mgZI_4	THIS OCCURS GETTING THIS SUCKER IS GETTING PAIN LIGHT LAST AIRBENDER GARBAGE PAINED AND I WANT TO SAY THIS I DO NOT THINK IT WAS LIKE LAST AIRBENDER GARBAGE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_5	I GO FOR LIKE THE MORE FULL THESE KITES HI FILMS I GUESS WITH THE OLDER PICTURE FROM A TOY STORY AND ALL THAT STUFF
5W7Z1C_fDaE_6	DOESNT HOLD BACK EVERYTHING
cXypl4FnoZo_28	PETER WAS A KNOWING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_18	WAS BY FAR MY FAVORITE ACTION SCENE IN THE MOVIE
VbQk4H8hgr0_14	BUT EVEN AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES
ZAIRrfG22O0_3	WERE A FEW FUNNY LINES
HEsqda8_d0Q_31	I CAN IMAGINE GETTING THIS ON TV AND WATCHING IT AT CHRISTMAS TIME BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL SO LIKE ITS NOT ABOUT COMMERCIALIZING A SIN ITS ABOUT YOU KNOW FAMILIES BEING TOGETHER
Sqr0AcuoNnk_21	AND THE THING IS LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS FOR POSITIVE GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN THIS WHOLE MOVIE
BI97DNYfe5I_10	OF THE CAR THE BLACK BEAUTY THAT WAS AMAZING ALL THE GUNS IN THE CAR THAT WAS REALLY SWEET
2WGyTLYerpo_11	ACTION IS REALLY INTENSE WHICH SURPRISED ME I
Ci-AH39fi3Y_41	I DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE THINKING
cXypl4FnoZo_6	AND I LIKE YOU KNOW GET A VERDICT LIKE YOU KNOW KIND OF RIDICULOUS
Bfr499ggo-0_21	YOUR STORY LINE IS
c5xsKMxpXnc_12	THERES NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT REALLY WITH THESE TWO
Sqr0AcuoNnk_1	I DONT REALLY KNOW I DONT ITS SO WEIRD
Sqr0AcuoNnk_20	WHAT ADVICE ARE ALWAYS ALWAYS KIND AND RENEE ZELLWEGER
BI97DNYfe5I_11	AND ALL THE ACTION SCENES WERE GREAT
2WGyTLYerpo_10	AND ITS SATISFACTORY THE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_40	WELL SMACK IN THE FACE FOR THE OTHER OPEN PLOT LINE
cXypl4FnoZo_7	AND SHE WAS KIND OF WEIRD DURING TWILIGHT
Bfr499ggo-0_20	WRITING IT IT IS THE FIRST
c5xsKMxpXnc_13	LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BUT NONE WHERE THESE TWO SHOULD BE TOGETHER THERES
Af8D0E4ZXaw_19	I THOUGHT WAS REALLY WELL PUT TOGETHER
VbQk4H8hgr0_15	I LOVE
ZAIRrfG22O0_2	ME IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME
HEsqda8_d0Q_30	BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY WANT TO GET IN

lXPQBPVc5Cw_4	I MEAN AND I DONT ACTUALLY GO AND IM NOT BEING BIASED BECAUSE I DONT REALLY GO FOR THE ANIMATED TYPE FILMS
5W7Z1C_fDaE_7	FROM THE WAY THAT ITS BEING RELEASED TO THE PERFORMANCES OF THE NIGHT TO THE STORY ITSELF IS ABSOLUTELY OVER THE TOP IMPRESSIVE
cXypl4FnoZo_29	PETER
OQvJTdtJ2H4_1	[UNK]
G6GlGvlkxAQ_18	WELL WHY ARE THEY CARRYING A HAMMER
c7UH_rxdZv4_17	JUST LIKE LOOK AT WHAT HE CAN DO YOU CAN DO LOTS OF STUFF FOR

VbQk4H8hgr0_42	NOT JUST PISSED ME OFF MORE BUT
2iD-tVS8NPw_30	ITS NOT LIKE THE GREEN LANTERN IS THE NEXT BATMAN BEGINS OR THE DARK KNIGHT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_7	TRUMP IS WINNING THEIR

cW1FSBF59ik_19	ANYTHING ELSE
0h-zjBukYpk_24	I MEAN THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_3	I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW ITS THE PERFORMANCES AND IT WERE SORT OF OVER OVER LOOKED AT THE ACADEMY AWARDS BECAUSE
d3_k5Xpfmik_19	THE STYLE OF THE FILM LIFE VIA THE FREEZE FRAMES A SLOW MOTION VIA THE GERMAN COOKS AND ALL THAT STUFF FEELS VERY KIND OF HIM TARANTINO ESQUE
9T9Hf74oK10_22	BUT ITS ITS SOMEWHAT MODERN I WOULD SAY ITS
VCslbP0mgZI_17	IF I DONT GIVE ZACK SNYDER THE BENEFIT OUT
9qR7uwkblbs_22	LIKE SHES MY SPIRIT ANIMAL AND THEN SHE WASNT
2WGyTLYerpo_51	SUCH AS SOMETIMES THE ALIENS IN THE WESTERN SETTING DO LOOK A LITTLE Q FEVER
W8NXH0Djyww_12	AND IT WAS JUST ALL ITS HYSTERICAL
W8NXH0Djyww_5	I HAD ALL THE STEREOTYPICAL TRAITS OF A WESTERN TOWN
k5Y_838nuGo_5	THIS IS QUITE A BIT OVERRATED
BvYR0L6f2Ig_14	THEY WOULD JUST THEY DIDNT WANT TO BE DOING ANYWAY
2iD-tVS8NPw_26	I MEAN IF HES ABLE TO DO ALL OF THIS SORT OF STUFF LIKE HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO REALLY PUT UP A FORCE THAT CAN PUSH HIM TO THE NEXT LEVEL OR OR DESTROY HIM AT THE SAME TIME
IumbAb8q2dM_22	YEAH SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU GUYS OF COURSE MOVING
VbQk4H8hgr0_54	IT WASNT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION TO SEE SO
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_7	MY GOD HOME WE HAD A REALLY DRY DIALOGUE
POKffnXeBds_6	ALL THE FUNNY PARTS WERENT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_10	WHO WROTE THIS ISNT THE BEST WRITER DEFINITELY BUT OVERALL
Ci-AH39fi3Y_2	SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS BUT I WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT SAW FIVE OKAY ALL
Njd1F0vZSm4_2	D C G I WORK THE THREE D IS SPECTACULAR
OQvJTdtJ2H4_10	ABOUT ONE AND A HALF STARS
iiK8YX8oH1E_17	BUT HE HAS SOME OF THE FUNNIER SCENES IN THIS MOVIE
OtBXNcAL_lE_17	AND SO SHES ALL SAD WALKING IN THE RAIN FOR LUBBOCK OFF
bOL9jKpeJRs_18	JUST A GREAT GREAT MOVIE I
Qr1Ca94K55A_14	BUT IF YOURE AN AVID MOVIE GOER LIKE I AM I TOTALLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS BECAUSE ITS JUST A FUN ENTERTAINING MOVIE AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL ENJOY IT
d6hH302o4v8_8	ITS VERY BORING
c5xsKMxpXnc_5	WHAT DATE DID NOT EXECUTE IT VERY WELL AND
f9O3YtZ2VfI_21	GOT TO MY FAVORITE ACTRESSES AND IT STILL IS WINNING CAKE BLANCHETT
9c67fiY0wGQ_2	BUT I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF ENJOYING THE MOVIE AND LAST SEEN
cM3Yna7AavY_15	I COULDNT EVEN WATCH IT
IumbAb8q2dM_1	I ALWAYS LIKE TO READ THE BOOK FIRST
6_0THN4chvY_10	THATS PROBABLY PART OF THE TRAILER THAT GOT ME TO GO SEE THE MOVIE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_13	IT JUST LACKED THE CHARM OF THOSE PAST MOVIES IT
pLTX3ipuDJI_9	I DONT YOU CANT HIDE FROM THOSE WITH UNKNOWN ACTORS SO EVEN IF SOMEONE IS IN IT FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU SHOULD TYPE THEM
zhpQhgha_KU_2	AND I LIKED THE FIRST GAME OF THE FIRST NAME IS REALLY GOOD
Nzq88NnDkEk_15	LETS TAKE A MAJOR ALMOST LOOK TO TRY TO YOU KNOW MAKE HER LOOK TOO BEAUTIFUL
9T9Hf74oK10_6	AND IT WAS IT WAS AWFUL BUT THERE
HEsqda8_d0Q_26	EVEN THOUGH I WAS LIKE WHO IS GOING TO HATE IT
bvLlb-M3UXU_15	HE IS A TERRIFIC SHAPE FOR A MAN TWICE MY AGE TO LOOK SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN ME THATS
cXypl4FnoZo_13	I I DONT LIKE WELL I DONT KNOW IF THEY DONT LIKE THIS BUT I WISH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT WHO THE WALLS ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_17	AND SO THATS PRETTY ENTERTAINING
zhpQhgha_KU_14	BUT A LOT OF THE FOOTAGE WAS KIND OF A MESS
d6hH302o4v8_22	IT WAS REALLY ME WILL
cW1FSBF59ik_9	I DO NOT TAKE RYAN REYNOLDS J C BOYS  IN THIS MOVIE
MLal-t_vJPM_18	OTHER THAN THOSE TWO THINGS
cW1FSBF59ik_23	WAIT I LOVE THE SCENE WHERE SHE WOULD GET THOSE WILL RAIN INTO THE TRUCK THATS A GOOD JACK OFF
Af8D0E4ZXaw_7	ALL THE GREEN LANTERN FANS OUT THERE I AM SO SORRY AND I
9T9Hf74oK10_18	SO LOOK OUT FOR THAT THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING
etzxEpPuc6I_4	THE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS LIKE I WANT TO COMPARE TO TRANSFORMERS TOO AND I ACTUALLY DID
7JsX8y1ysxY_25	LIKE HE WAS INCREDIBLE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_22	I THINK THE DIRECTORS OF THOR AND HIS SUPPORTERS DID THAT RIGHT AWAY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_15	YEAH HES A COMPETENT ACTION DIRECTOR IS
LSi-o-IrDMs_13	IS A TERRIBLE PICTURE BUT
BI97DNYfe5I_2	I WAS EXPECTING SETH ROGAN TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS IN THIS MOVIE BUT HE WAS
rnaNMUZpvvg_6	COULD BARELY STAY AWAKE THROUGH THE MOVIE
tIrG4oNLFzE_17	HEY SHE JUST LIT THE FLAME AND EVERYTHING THE THING DOES PUT ABOUT TWO THINGS I ACTUALLY FEEL YES YOU CAN GET IT SHE CAN DO THAT
I5y0__X72p0_16	ITS NOT GREAT ITS
_dI--eQ6qVU_24	THEY TOOK A NEW SPIN ON IT AND
d3_k5Xpfmik_4	IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT YOU REALLY CAUGHT JUST ANYONE IN THIS SITUATION
8qrpnFRGt2A_8	AND AGAIN I DID PAYING CLOSER ATTENTION TO MY TO FOLLOW THAT MORE IN
8d-gEyoeBzc_9	THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL DEVELOPED THE OLDER CHARACTERS
jUzDDGyPkXU_16	IT KEEPS YOUR INTEREST IN THE ACTION SCENES AT LEAST DURING THIS MOVIE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_15	IT WAS SO BAD AND I JUST DID NOT ENJOY IT
TvyZBvOMOTc_3	THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS A SHOW ABOUT GOING ACROSS IRELAND WAS ASTOUNDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
OtBXNcAL_lE_4	BECAUSE I CANT STAND MOVIES THAT ARE SO PREDICTABLE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_16	AND SOMETHING THAT I CANT FIND ANYTHING ELSE TO COMPARE IT TO
k5Y_838nuGo_15	BECAUSE THE FIRST TWO WERE GREAT AND THEY BROUGHT THE KIDS AND IT MADE IT MORE KIDDY FRIENDLY MOVIE
bOL9jKpeJRs_34	I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LOVE IT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_2	I THOUGHT THE FIRST ONE WAS CREATED AN INVENTIVE AND REALLY THROW SOMETHING NEW TO CINEMA
QN9ZIUWUXsY_16	AND THEN TAKE THAT WORLD AND THEN SAT LIKE A CRAP TON OF REALLY KINETIC REALLY WELL DONE ACTION SEQUENCES IN IT AND YOU HAVE TRON LEGACY
BioHAh1qJAQ_20	BUT SAN FRAN MEETS HIS FATHER AND TRYING BASICALLY TURNED INTO A STAR WARS PREQUEL AFTER THAT ONE
TvyZBvOMOTc_15	ALL IN ALL IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A CURE MEANT A COMPANY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SETTING THEN THIS IS PROBABLY THE GOOD MOVIES FOR YOU
Clx4VXItLTE_17	FIRST IT REALLY SURPRISES OF WHAT LITTLE
tmZoasNr4rU_5	MAYBE MONITORED IM NOT SURE IN JUST
yDtzw_Y-7RU_9	AND ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS FILM ITS IN ITS DEVOTION IS THAT SOMETIMES MY CHILDREN COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHATS BEING SAID BECAUSE THEY WERE SPEAKING DICKEN SONY IN ENGLISH
Af8D0E4ZXaw_23	AND HAL JORDAN FLIES OFF TO THE GREEN LANTERN CORPS PLANET OF A LUNCH AND THE MOVIE STARTS SEQUEL BAITING
9J25DZhivz8_21	THATS A GREAT EFFECT
dq3Nf_lMPnE_14	UNLESS YOUR KIDS ARE DYING TO SEE IT BUT WAIT FOR THE DVD I GIVE
Clx4VXItLTE_3	I DO JOIN THE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_8	THE PERFORMANCES ARE MAY
rnaNMUZpvvg_13	BUT HE WASNT EVEN INTERESTING
f_pcplsH_V0_14	BUT IT ACTUALLY MAKES THE CHARACTERS COGNITION NOT JUST OF THE GENRE WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE IN THEIR OWN FRANCHISE TO RIDICULOUS EXTENT
8qrpnFRGt2A_16	I FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING ONE OF THOSE ARMY OF ONE COMMERCIAL SOMETIMES
Bfr499ggo-0_5	ACTIVATION HE KERRY WARD LAST HER RENTON HE HAD THEY WERE NOT WELL AND
5W7Z1C_fDaE_14	ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HATING ON IT I DONT KNOW WHAT THEYRE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT ITS
bOL9jKpeJRs_22	I THINK ITS BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A MOVING FILM
1iG0909rllw_11	THING IS ITS A VERY GOOD TRANSLATION OF THE BOOK
fvVhgmXxadc_9	KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A VIDEO GAME CERTAIN WAY FACT
tStelxIAHjw_2	AND I THINK THE LAST MOVIE I SAW IN THEATERS WHAT IS TOY STORY THREE AND I HATED IT

GWuJjcEuzt8_11	SIXTEEN BUT NOT SLACK KEY YOU KNOW
BXuRRbG0Ugk_3	I MEAN IT WASNT A BAD YEAR BUT
BioHAh1qJAQ_7	BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE FIRST PART OF THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING
VbQk4H8hgr0_39	BUT I STILL FOLLOW POINTLESS IN THE END OF THE MOVIE
fvVhgmXxadc_13	KIND OF PLAYING WITH THE IDEA OF WHATS REAL WHATS NOT BUT THE MATRIX FILMS DID
phBUpBr1hSo_4	I DONT THINK THAT THIS ONE GOT AS MUCH BUZZ AND AS MUCH MEDIA ATTENTION AND WORD OF MOUTH YOU KNOW SPREADING AROUND AND STUFF
phBUpBr1hSo_15	CARS JUST KIND OF DRAGGED ON ANY KIND IT YOU KNOW IVE SEEN IN THE MOVIE THEATER AND THIS IS A BIG ACTION MOVIE ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVIES OF THE SUMMER AND YOU KIND OF JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW REST YOUR HEAD WHILE YOU WATCHED BECAUSE SOME OF THE SEQUENCES AND SOME OF THE SCENES ARE JUST KINDA LONG

VbQk4H8hgr0_19	AND SIMPLY IT WAS ALL FOR ME
nzpVDcQ0ywM_6	IT WAS REALLY KIND OF DOWN DOWN FOR US
Af8D0E4ZXaw_15	I ALSO LOVE THE CASTING MARK STRONGS SINESTRO HES
Clx4VXItLTE_21	EVERYONE JUST SCREAMS IN
BioHAh1qJAQ_16	THE MAN THAT IS HALF AN INCH OR TWO GREAT HES PUT IN THE GAMES

ZUXBRvtny7o_31	THEY GOT ALL CHARACTERS MAKE THIS MOVIE I REALLY GO TO THE MOVIES
_dI--eQ6qVU_12	FOR THE HUMOR REALLY JUST NAILED IT
vyB00TXsimI_12	OTHER NOTABLE MENTIONS ARE CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER PLAYS
I5y0__X72p0_20	AS I WANNA MOVIE THINKING THERES NO WAY FOR
LSi-o-IrDMs_25	BE COOL TO SEE I MEAN INITIALLY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_23	AND NOW THAT IVE SEEN HIM IN THE ROLE I CANT IMAGINE ANY OTHER CURRENT ACTOR TRYING TO PULL IT OFF HE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_14	BUT THE AUDIENCE THAT WAS WATCHING IT MEANS GETTING THE PAY OFF RIGHT AWAY
7JsX8y1ysxY_13	ALL RIGHT SO NOTHING THE NUDITY
d3_k5Xpfmik_15	THE SEQUENCES OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM WHICH FEATURED COLUMBUS EXPLAINING SOME OF THESE RULES TO SURVIVING A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE ARE REALLY WELL DONE

c7UH_rxdZv4_6	THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE OBNOXIOUS MAIN CHARACTERS IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME
_dI--eQ6qVU_28	AND I WOULD WANT TO KEEP THE SECRET SYSTEM EVEN LONGER RATHER THAN SHORTER
Bfr499ggo-0_16	BY THE MEMBER OR CHARLOTTE IN CONCERT BECAUSE YOU HAVENT EXPERIENCED BACK
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_1	TION OF ROBIN HOOD STARRING RUSSELL CROWE FIRST THING I GOTTA SAY ROUTE THAT I WAS DREADING GOING IN TO SEE THIS MOVIE
k5Y_838nuGo_19	AND THIS WAS THE FIRST ONE KIND OF HAS THE
2WGyTLYerpo_26	IT WAS REALLY COOL WHEN THEY DID THE X
OtBXNcAL_lE_8	BUT YOU KNOW I I TOOK A CHANCE
BI97DNYfe5I_27	I EXPECTED A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUSNESS
lXPQBPVc5Cw_19	THERE TWO OTHERS WERE JUST BORED
bOL9jKpeJRs_7	NOT THAT MUCH
73jzhE8R1TQ_12	IT ISNT REALLY A BIG DEAL BUT AND YOU LIKE THE FACT THAT JOHN HAD AN IPHONE BECAUSE

Nzq88NnDkEk_23	I JUST REALLY DONT LIKE IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_1	WHICH IS A REBOOT I GUESS WOULD BE THE BEST TERMS FOR THE BLUE WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE MOVIE CLASSES ENDS
5W7Z1C_fDaE_18	BEING RELEASED IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY
Bfr499ggo-0_9	YOU KNOW THE PREMISE IS THAT KENNY AND
tmZoasNr4rU_17	THE ACTION FEELS THAT ITS YEAH ITS ITS PRETTY MUCH JUST THE CLICK OR SLASH ONE SCREEN YOU KNOW YES WHAT SHOULD
0h-zjBukYpk_3	MY REASON IM A COMIC BOOK FAN
QN9ZIUWUXsY_4	I CAN TELL YOU THAT TRON LEGACY IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE
wMbj6ajWbic_9	THE SCRIPT IS COREY I
G-xst2euQUc_4	IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN PRODUCTION COMPANIES START PUSHING MOVIES THAT FAR AHEAD OF WHEN THEYRE GOING TO BE RELEASED THAT USUALLY MEANS THAT THEYRE NOT GOING TO BE GREAT
Jkswaaud0hk_8	THERE ARE SOME FUNNY LINES
iiK8YX8oH1E_2	THEYRE THE REAL STARS SOMETHING BORROWED IS JENNIFER DID WHEN HE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_17	AND IF YOURE GONNA DO MOSTLY CG I JUST MAKE AN ANIMATED MOVIE
BI97DNYfe5I_31	TWO PRETTY INTENSE AT THE END
fvVhgmXxadc_5	PRETTY HEAVILY IN CONCORD IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE
2WGyTLYerpo_30	AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT MY
OtBXNcAL_lE_21	I MEAN YOU CAN GO SEE IT I PERSONALLY DIDNT LIKE IT BECAUSE
G-xst2euQUc_10	AGAIN IT DOES REALLY TUG AT THE HEARTSTRINGS WITH THE LITTLE BABY ANIMALS IN THE BEGINNING
aiEXnCPZubE_28	I CANDY AND JUST
2iD-tVS8NPw_10	AND I JUST HAD FUN WATCHING THIS MOVIE IS
IumbAb8q2dM_14	IT TURNS OUT THAT JAMES FREIGHT WHO I REALLY LIKE IT HE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_2	AND HE WHAT HE DOES WITH HANNAH IS HE MAKES THE MOVIE UNLIKE ANYTHING WEVE SEEN BEFORE
pLTX3ipuDJI_14	SUPPORTING THE SCENE FROM THE AUDIENCE FOR CHARACTERS
BvYR0L6f2Ig_22	SECOND
phBUpBr1hSo_8	AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE TOO MUCH TOO FAST I MEAN THEYRE ALREADY TELLING EACH OTHER THEY LOVE EACH OTHER AND TALKING ABOUT GETTING WEDDING RINGS AND SPENDING THE REST OF LIFE TOGETHER THEY LIVED TOGETHER I MEAN ITS JUST WAY TOO MUCH TOO FAST THEY TRY TO PUT HEART INTO IT BY YOU KNOW HIM SAYING YOU KNOW YOURE THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IN THIS WORLD YOU KNOW I DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF YOU KNOW BECAUSE HE THINKS HES DOING CRAZY SELF SACRIFICING HIS LIFE AND THEN HE DOES CRAZY STUFF TO SAVOR AND HES LIKE I LOVE YOU AND YOU KNOW JUST ALL THE SAPPY BLAH BLAH BLAH SEVENTY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_37	BUT LIKE I SAID THE UP A LOT OF TALKING EVERYTHING THAT WAS REALLY REALLY AWESOME
W8NXH0Djyww_24	BUT THIS MOVIE IT HAD EVERYTHING HUMOR ROMANCE ACTION OF

ob23OKe5a9Q_11	Q YOU KNOW THE ACTORS DID A GREAT JOB THINGS WERE STILL LIGHT SWITCHES SHOWS GEORGE LOPEZ NEIL PATRICK HERES KATY PERRY AND SO FORTH
phBUpBr1hSo_19	ABOUT PRETTY GOOD SCRIPT
8OtFthrtaJM_6	FIRST OFF THE COMMERCIAL MAKES THE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MISTAKE OF SAYING THAT IT IS MORE THOUGHT PROVOKING THAN INCEPTION
Vj1wYRQjB-o_6	LIKE I SAID I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT
2iD-tVS8NPw_4	ITS A HUGE SORT OF SPECTACLE MOVIE THAT IS GREAT FOR THE SUMMER TIME YOU KNOW THIS
aiEXnCPZubE_23	COULD HAVE INTERESTING BACKSTORIES
X3j2zQgwYgE_4	OKAY
7JsX8y1ysxY_34	BUT ITS EXTREMELY DARK
Iu2PFX3z_1s_9	I GAVE IT A B
Jkswaaud0hk_15	BUT OVERALL I THOUGHT IT WAS IT IS A FUN PICTURE I I
wMbj6ajWbic_16	BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MOVIE THATS REALLY WHAT IT MAY HAVE TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT I HAD IN TERMINATOR SALVATION
phBUpBr1hSo_3	I THINK ADAMANT MOVIES ARE PHENOMENAL ESPECIALLY THAT FIRST ONE
d6hH302o4v8_33	IT WAS TERRIBLE

GWuJjcEuzt8_16	ALL THE AWESOME MOVIES THAT WE HAD IN THE YELLOW INCEPTION IN THE NEXT ONE AND YOU KNOW THE SOCIAL NETWORK
BXuRRbG0Ugk_4	THERE WAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL LEFT ON THE TABLE
ob23OKe5a9Q_6	CHEESY JOKES SHEETS JOKES AND MOST TIMES FUNNY BECAUSE THEYRE PRETTY BAD
Njd1F0vZSm4_11	THEY REALLY NEEDED TO SOMEHOW SET THEM APART WITH ARMOR
cM3Yna7AavY_4	I HAD SOME HIGH X HIGH EXPECTATIONS PER SE I WAS DEFINITELY EXPECTING THIS TO BE A GOOD MOVIE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_6	NOT A BAD IDEA FOR SEQUEL
Oz06ZWiO20M_8	BUT ITS NOT BAD I THINK THE WAY MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING ITS BETTER
Nzq88NnDkEk_28	DID I WANT TO GIVE THIS MOVIE A BAD REVIEW I
fvVhgmXxadc_14	WELL ACTUALLY THE BEST PERSON IS TO REDUCE FILM ACTUALLY WOULD BE SO LIKE PANS LABYRINTH
vvZ4IcEtiZc_10	ITS SORT OF LIKE A CONTRIVED PLOT THATS BEEN USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
Bfr499ggo-0_2	ITS VERY
8qrpnFRGt2A_11	WHICH I MEAN FOR A MOVIE ABOUT GI JOE NINETY MINUTES IS ENOUGH
5W7Z1C_fDaE_13	ITS SO WELL DONE FOR
f_pcplsH_V0_13	MAKE THAT MOVIE I WANT TO SEE BUT
0h-zjBukYpk_8	AND IN MY OPINION HE CARRIED THE MOVIE FINE
rnaNMUZpvvg_14	THEY GAVE HIM NO NO CHARACTER LIKE HE HAD NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHAT
iiK8YX8oH1E_9	I THINK WITH WITH THESE KIND OF MOVIES WE CANT PREDICT THE
ZUXBRvtny7o_16	THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE EAST AT THESE MOBY EAST CELL C C
wMbj6ajWbic_2	AND FIRST OF ALL I ACTUALLY WAS NEVER A HUGE FAN OF THE GI JOE TV SERIES

QN9ZIUWUXsY_11	THE DIRECTION IS A BIT ITS WOBBLY
WKA5OygbEKI_8	RANGEL KIND OF FALLS INTO THAT
TvyZBvOMOTc_12	AND MOSTLY ACTORS AMY ADAMS AND MATTHEW GOOD WORK WELL WITH EACH OTHER AND
BioHAh1qJAQ_27	COLOGNE WHICH IS THE PROGRAM THAT HE CREATED THE FIRST MOVIE POOLS OF MONEY IN THE BOILER MOMENT IN THE SENSE THAT HE TURNED INTO A CRAZY JEALOUS PSYCHO STALKER 
BvYR0L6f2Ig_5	SO IT WAS JUST  EQUAL TO THE FAST FROM
dq3Nf_lMPnE_13	IF IT WERENT FOR THE GREAT CHARACTERS OF SHREK AND HIS SUPPORTING CAST WHO ARE STILL VOICED BY THE ORIGINAL STARS MIKE MYERS EDDIE MURPHY CAMERON DIAZ AND ANTONIO BANDERAS THE FILM WOULD BE A REAL BUST
Clx4VXItLTE_4	EXACTLY IT SCARED

BXuRRbG0Ugk_28	I REALLY DONT CARE THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE WALKING CLICHES WHEN THEYRE THIS WELL DONE
7JsX8y1ysxY_18	BUT SHE ACTED LIKE A POWER RANGER
c7UH_rxdZv4_10	SOMETHING THAT JUST KIND OF MAKES SENSE SO SLIGHTLY ENDEARING EVEN OTHER KIND OF A JACK  YOU KNOW YOURE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_4	THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT MOVIES THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR I MEAN ON THE KINGS SPEECH BLACK SWAN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN HOURS INCEPTION
9T9Hf74oK10_25	AND I THINK EARLY ON THE TWIST IS REVEALED

Oz06ZWiO20M_20	AND THEN YOU KNOW PUT IN SOME ACTION OR SOME ROMANCE AND SEX OR WHATEVER TO KEEP PEOPLE SORT OF ENGAGE
6Egk_28TtTM_10	I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I SAT IN HIS KNEES KIND OF SCARY
ZAIRrfG22O0_5	MOVIE THEATER GAME A CREDIT TO FUTURE MOVIES THAT I APPRECIATE IT
atnd_PF-Lbs_21	THE RACE STADIUM SCENE AND THE MALL SCENES IN THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR MASS AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE DIE IN THE CRAZIEST WAYS ARE PRETTY GOOD FOR A LATE NIGHT BUDDY VIEWING SCENE KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY LATE NIGHT BUDDY
VbQk4H8hgr0_12	ANYTHING ORIGINAL
BI97DNYfe5I_16	THE ACTING WAS WAS PRETTY GOOD

f9O3YtZ2VfI_30	MY NEIGHBOR PROBABLY THINKS IM CRAZY GOING ABOUT MOVIES TO A CAMERA
k5Y_838nuGo_28	IT HAD ME LAUGHING OUT LOUD
2WGyTLYerpo_17	IF THE ACTION IS REALLY COOL
Sqr0AcuoNnk_6	AND THIS IS THE THING FRIENDS OF BENEFITS AND NO STRINGS ATTACHED THEY ARE THE SAME MOVIE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING TO THE SAME POINT THAT SAME POINT
_dI--eQ6qVU_19	IT MAKES IT MORE VISUALLY APPEALING AND
vyB00TXsimI_19	I THOUGHT IT WAS FINE
c5xsKMxpXnc_14	NO REASON WHY SHOULD BE TOGETHER
BvYR0L6f2Ig_25	YOU ACTUALLY FEEL FOR HER CHARACTER
pLTX3ipuDJI_13	JUST LIKE WHEN THE GIRL TELLS THE EXACT STORY THE FIRST MOVIE
2WGyTLYerpo_60	GONNA GIVE IT AN EIGHT OUT OF TEN IT
W8NXH0Djyww_23	SO COOL
Ci-AH39fi3Y_30	BUT IT WAS NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING AND SERIOUSLY EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO THE END WAS BETTER THAN THE ENDING WHICH
9qR7uwkblbs_13	STONE WAS IN THIS MOVIE AS WELL AND IF YOU WOULDNT REALLY KNOW IT BECAUSE SHE WAS ALREADY IN IT
G-xst2euQUc_17	BUT THERE REALLY HASNT BEEN MUCH THAT HAS COME OUT THIS YEAR SO FAR THAT IVE BEEN DYING TO GO SEE
Jkswaaud0hk_19	I CAN SEE IT
2iD-tVS8NPw_17	I THINK WHAT I JUST MAKE THIS YOU KNOW MOVIE THIS LIVE ACTION MOVIE INTO A CARTOON OF THAT
IumbAb8q2dM_13	I CANT WAIT TILL THE NEXT ONE COMES UP TO
Iu2PFX3z_1s_5	WHATS REALLY NEAT ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THE CHEMICAL BROTHERS TO THE SOUNDTRACK SWISS POST POUNDING THE ENTIRE WAY THROUGH
X3j2zQgwYgE_8	AND I GUESS NORMALLY STRUCK IS FOR ADULTS
7JsX8y1ysxY_38	SO AT THE END THERES NOT REALLY A WHOLE LOT OF REDEEMING VALUE THEY I THINK YOU COME UP WITH
2iD-tVS8NPw_8	IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD
c7UH_rxdZv4_30	AND ITS KIND OF INTERESTING
QN9ZIUWUXsY_3	I DO THINK ITS A VERY INTERESTING ONCE
0h-zjBukYpk_4	THAT LIKE TO SEE COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS TREATED RESPONSIBLY
rnaNMUZpvvg_18	IT JUST SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE OH HES SO COOL WE SO OFTEN LIKE YOU NEVER SEE THAT IN THE MOVIE THIS PERSON WHO HAD ME JUST KILLS EVERYBODY EVEN IM JUST LIKE BUT THAT WAS SO UNNECESSARY WIRES
tmZoasNr4rU_10	MAYBE ONLY FIVE JOKES MADE ME LAUGH

tStelxIAHjw_9	I DONT THINK IT WAS CUTE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_10	THE MOVIES TOO LONG
bOL9jKpeJRs_29	ITS REALLY INTENSE
2WGyTLYerpo_37	HAIRSTON FORDS ALSO GOOD HES
fvVhgmXxadc_2	BUT UNFORTUNATELY ITS JUST AN UGLY WILD VIOLENCE ON VAULTING AND SADISTIC EXERCISE THAT
G-xst2euQUc_3	I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO GO SEE IT
iiK8YX8oH1E_5	IT KIND OF FOLLOWS THE PATH OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN TO ROBERTSON THE EXCEPT IT TAKES THIRTY MINUTES LONGER TO DEVIATE FROM THE SCRIPT OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING
Oz06ZWiO20M_4	I WOULD SAY I I ENJOYED SUCKER PUNCH
cM3Yna7AavY_8	THEY ARE DOING BROTHER BEAR
VbQk4H8hgr0_7	OFFERED NOTHING OF THE SUCH IT WASNT
HEsqda8_d0Q_17	ONE OF MY OTHER CONCERNS WITH
BXuRRbG0Ugk_8	FORTUNATELY SOME GOOD DECISIONS WERE MADE BEFORE THE CAMERAS STARTED ROLLING JOHN
bvLlb-M3UXU_24	IT JUST IT FELT KIND OF CUT AND DRY WE
Nzq88NnDkEk_6	BUT AS THE TRAILERS CAME OUT I I REALLY LIKED WHAT I WAS SEEING AND
Nzq88NnDkEk_24	BUT IF YOURE LOOKING TO SPEND SOME MONEY GO CHECK IT OUT MAYBE YOU WILL LIKE IT BUT

Sqr0AcuoNnk_11	BUT HE HAD A LOT OF REALLY SAD MOMENTS
73jzhE8R1TQ_15	BUT MY OPINION LIKE YOU SHOULDNT HAVE AN AFFIRMATION THAT CARE ABOUT THE LATEST TRENDS SO THATS REALLY WHAT KIND OF
8qrpnFRGt2A_3	SO I NEED DIDNT HAVE VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS MOVIE
8d-gEyoeBzc_2	BUT IM ALSO GOING TO GIVE THE REASONS OF WHY I DONT THINK ITS GOING TO BE A CLASSIC IN THE SAME VEIN AS THE FIRST MOVIE PREDATOR OR ALIENS
2WGyTLYerpo_21	REALLY STRONG
TvyZBvOMOTc_8	BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT DOESNT REALLY HOLD UP UNDER INSPECTION
BI97DNYfe5I_20	AND
BvYR0L6f2Ig_9	FIRST IM GOING TO GET INTO THE ACTING WHICH WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE SECOND ONE
HEsqda8_d0Q_1	[UNK]

yDtzw_Y-7RU_2	THIS FILM IS SLAVISHLY DEVOTED TO THE ORIGINAL BOOK OR NOVEL NOVEL BY CHARLES DICKENS
03bSnISJMiM_10	EVERY SET OF PARTS
v0zCBqDeKcE_5	ITS SUCH A FEEL GOOD COMEDY
Clx4VXItLTE_8	INSIDIOUS M START REALLY GOOD
cXypl4FnoZo_18	I DONT I THINK HE MAYBE HE GOT MAD WHEN I DONT
Oz06ZWiO20M_16	EVERY MAINSTREAM NARRATIVE FILM IS ABOUT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND PLOT AND THEN SPECTACLE LIKE IN THIRD PLACE
2WGyTLYerpo_7	AND MAYBE THIS VISUAL EFFECTS
d6hH302o4v8_29	NO THEY JUST TRIED SO HARD TO LOOK AT THE CJI THAT THEY PUT THE MR SO MUCH C GI YOU
Ci-AH39fi3Y_26	THE ENDING WAS NOT YOU KNOW CRAZY SHOCKING OR ANYTHING LIKE USUAL
MLal-t_vJPM_13	YOU MIGHT AS WELL
cW1FSBF59ik_2	RIGHT FIRST OF ALL ID LIKE TO SAY LITTLE THREE JAMES ORIGINALLY ANYWAY
0h-zjBukYpk_15	BUT ITS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
03bSnISJMiM_4	NOT A WHOLE BUNCH INITIATIVE
Qr1Ca94K55A_4	BUT THE REAL STAR THAT FELL OUT OF THIS MOVIE IT WAS MORNING FEATURES CHARACTER OR WELL INTENTIONED
9T9Hf74oK10_13	THOSE THREE ARE SOME OF THE BEST YOUNG ACTORS OF TODAY
c7UH_rxdZv4_26	NOTHING THATS WORTH GOING TO THEATERS TO SEE
LSi-o-IrDMs_18	THE THREE D ITSELF REALLY HAD IMPROVED

1iG0909rllw_20	THE SCRIPTS IT LEFT FULL THE KEY CLOSE AND THE MOTION FROM THE CARTOONS TO BE EXPOSED THROUGH DOG
LSi-o-IrDMs_4	JUST CANT WALK IN EXPECTING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT
ZUXBRvtny7o_20	DATING IS OPEN FOR A SEQUEL
ZUXBRvtny7o_7	THIS SOUNDTRACK HES GOOD HES REALLY GOOD AT SOME REALLY GREAT SERVICE

6_0THN4chvY_4	THE GREAT KIDS TO
LSi-o-IrDMs_22	AND IT MAKES IT WORTH GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOUVE GOT THE DOLBY THREE D SOMEWHERE IN YOUR IN YOUR TOWN
7JsX8y1ysxY_14	THE WHAT SUCKED WHAT WAS BAD WAS MARINE ACKERMAN GIRL PLACE THE SILK FACTOR TO JUNIOR
G6GlGvlkxAQ_13	AND THE SOULS OF THE NBC RECENT FLOP OF THE CAKE WHICH IS SHOW I LOVED

yvsjCA6Y5Fc_19	LIKE WERE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO ARE IN THEIR MID TO MID THIRTIES AT THE OLDEST AND THEYRE LOOKING PRETTY ROUGH IN THIS MOVIE LIKE
8qrpnFRGt2A_26	GRIFOLS AS FAR AS LIKE JUST CG I HAD THE RIGHT THERES TIMES WHEN THERES LIKE HUMAN FACE AND EVERYTHING AROUND THE FACES CARTOON C GI COMPUTER FAX
0h-zjBukYpk_14	ITS A SMART MOVE SINCE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE REAL COMIC BOOK FAN TO GET WHAT HIS NAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE
03bSnISJMiM_5	I GUESS THIS YEAR
yDtzw_Y-7RU_24	WOULD NOT TAKE A YOUNG
Qr1Ca94K55A_5	AND HIS ACTING WASNT REALLY IN THAT MOVIE BUT
9T9Hf74oK10_12	BUT REGARDLESS I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE
c7UH_rxdZv4_27	AND YEAH I THINK THE ONLY CHARACTER WHO ACTUALLY SHOW THEIR MOTIVATIONS BEHIND ANYTHING THEY DID WAS THE VILLAIN
LSi-o-IrDMs_19	THE COLOR LOOKS GREAT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_28	SO THAT MAKES SENSE
BI97DNYfe5I_8	YOU KNOW THATS OKAY I GUESS
cXypl4FnoZo_19	BUT YEAH WHATEVER HI HE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE SHOWING A LOT BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN UP TO IT THEY KIND OF THE LIKE ALL THE SAME THE END

2WGyTLYerpo_6	CINEMATOGRAPHY IN SCHOOL HES GREAT
d6hH302o4v8_28	THE LAST HALF HOUR MOVIE ITS STILL LIKE THEY HAD LIKE A C GI ORGASM
Ci-AH39fi3Y_27	IT WAS NOT A HUGE SO I TWISTED MOMENT
MLal-t_vJPM_12	ILL GET ANGRY ABOUT IT MICHAEL CERA DOESNT PLAY THIS CHARACTER IN THIS FILM BUT
cW1FSBF59ik_3	THE FIRST THING YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN KIND OF FREAKED OUT THE WHOLE TIME YOU KNOW
BvYR0L6f2Ig_8	I REALLY LIKE THIS

VbQk4H8hgr0_25	I DONT SUGGEST ANYONE GO SEE
atnd_PF-Lbs_16	BUT THE WAY ITS CALLED OFFICE THAT WAS
03bSnISJMiM_11	[UNK]
yDtzw_Y-7RU_3	NUMBER ONE IT MEANS ITS MUCH SCARIER THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE
Clx4VXItLTE_9	LIKE THE CRACKED ON STRAIGHT AWAY WITH WHAT THE HELLS GOING ON

Bfr499ggo-0_10	THERE ARE FEWER NICE MOMENT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_7	FINALLY GOOD LUCK
6Egk_28TtTM_6	AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR AGES
_dI--eQ6qVU_1	BUT I CAN SAFELY ASSURE YOU THAT EVEN IF THEY DIDNT IT WOULD STILL BE A HIT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_10	ENDS AT PRESENT ITS HAD ITS MOMENTS
bOL9jKpeJRs_1	AND I WAS UNBELIEVABLY SHOCKED AT HOW MUCH I LOVED IT
73jzhE8R1TQ_14	ESPECIALLY SINCE YOURE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION IS I THINK IF YOU LIKE SCRAPING BY IN OR THEY CAN BE TO LEVERAGE
8qrpnFRGt2A_2	JUST WANTED SOMETHING THAT WATCH MALLS FALSELY
8d-gEyoeBzc_3	WHICH I THINK RODRIGUEZ WAS CRYING FOR HE THAT HE HE WAY SAID WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DO A SEQUEL THAT HE WANTED THIS TO BE THE PREDATOR EQUIVALENT OF IRANIANS
2WGyTLYerpo_20	SHE YOU
BI97DNYfe5I_21	YOULL LAUGH
TvyZBvOMOTc_9	ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT COME TO STOP FROM GETTING TO THE DESTINATION ARE ALTHOUGH PLAUSIBLE LITTLE WEEK
Oz06ZWiO20M_5	I WAS MORE ENTERTAINED BY IT THEN BATTLE LA WHICH WAS JUST A SLOW LONG AND BORING AND I JUST FOUND IT TOTALLY UNINTERESTING
cM3Yna7AavY_9	SO I GUESS PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SEE OF PETER ANIMATED FILMS SO
VbQk4H8hgr0_6	I MEAN I WENT IN THERE HOPING TO SEE SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND FUNNY LIKE THE FIRST TWO AND
HEsqda8_d0Q_16	THE VOICE IS REALLY GOOD THAT
bvLlb-M3UXU_25	SOURCES POINTING I WISH THIS HAPPENED EARLIER IN YOUR CAREER SO
BXuRRbG0Ugk_9	THIS PROBABLY HAD THE UNFORTUNATE SIDE EFFECT OF RAISING FAN EXPECTATIONS TO UNREASONABLE LEVELS
Nzq88NnDkEk_7	I THINK THE MUSIC THERE KIND OF WITH THE SOUNDTRACK REALLY GOT ME EXCITED ABOUT SEEING THIS MOVIE AND
VbQk4H8hgr0_33	I MEAN THERES A FEW MOMENTS YOU KNOW THAT ARE ORIGINAL AND FUNNY YOU
Nzq88NnDkEk_25	FROM MY REVIEW IM GONNA SAY IM GONNA GIVE IT TWO THUMBS DOWN RELEASE THE
0h-zjBukYpk_5	THAT BEFORE WE GO ON WITH THAT I MUST SAY THAT THIS HAD A SURPRISINGLY DECENT CAST
rnaNMUZpvvg_19	KILLING THESE PEOPLE YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHATS GOING ON LIKE DUDE GET OVER YOURSELF
QN9ZIUWUXsY_2	AND I DONT THINK THATS A VERY GOOD MOVIE
tmZoasNr4rU_11	ALTHOUGH I LIKE I LIKE DARK HUMOR ONE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_23	ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KNOW THE MERRY MEN WHO ALL BUT ONE OF THEM ARE PROBABLY EARLY TWENTIES AND ONE OF THOSE MAYBE MID TWENTIES AND MEANWHILE ARE HANGING OUT WITH PAPARAZZI SOUL IT JUST LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW ITS BEEN TWO GUYS HANGING AND SO ON BUT THEIR DAD ALONG BECAUSE HE OFFERED
tStelxIAHjw_8	I DIDNT THINK IT WAS FUNNY
f9O3YtZ2VfI_11	I JUST NEED TO CUT THAT OUT
bOL9jKpeJRs_28	THERES A LOT OF BUZZ ABOUT IT LATELY AND EVERYONES YOU KNOW A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OVER IT
fvVhgmXxadc_3	I GOT VERY LITTLE JOY OUT OF
2WGyTLYerpo_36	ITS AN ACCENT PRETTY CONVINCING
G-xst2euQUc_2	I DID NOT THINK I WAS GONNA LIKE IT
iiK8YX8oH1E_4	IF YOU CAN TOLERATE HER THE REST OF THE MOVIE ISNT ANY BETTER
G-xst2euQUc_16	IM NOT REALLY IN A BIG HURRY I USED TO SEE ANIMATED MOVIES
Jkswaaud0hk_18	YOU LADIES GO TOGETHER TO SEE IF THE OTHER CELL
2iD-tVS8NPw_16	NOT REALLY A HUGE FAN OF HAVING LIKE ALL THESE THREE D CHARACTERS BECAUSE
IumbAb8q2dM_12	GETS MORE DETAILS SO I CANT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT NOW
Iu2PFX3z_1s_4	HE PUTS THEM IN VERY STRANGE AND UNUSUAL CHARACTERS WE
X3j2zQgwYgE_9	BUT BLACK YOU KNOW VERY LACKLUSTER
7JsX8y1ysxY_39	BUT ARENT YOU KNOW WERE ALWAYS GOOD
2iD-tVS8NPw_9	THE REST OF IT DOES LOOK GOOD AS WELL
c7UH_rxdZv4_31	I MEAN THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT SHOWS GENUINE CARE FOR OTHER PEOPLE BE THE VILLAIN
pLTX3ipuDJI_12	SHE GOT LAWRENCE RESTAURANT COMES IN AND TELLS THE CHARACTERS THINGS ONLY SCREENWRITERS SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS GETS A LITTLE MORE RISKY PHONY FEELS WHOLE THING
BvYR0L6f2Ig_24	JUST LISTEN TO THE MOTION TO STRESS OF CHARACTERS SO WELL
2WGyTLYerpo_61	WAS REALLY FOND OF
Ci-AH39fi3Y_31	SHES STILL GOOD BECAUSE
W8NXH0Djyww_22	A COVERED WAGON HORSE KIND OF COWBOY CHASE SEQUENCE
9qR7uwkblbs_12	THEYRE JUST LIKE LIKE ZOOMING IN ON HIM AND IM JUST LIKE SITTING HERE LIKE AMYS MOTHER  DROP
lXPQBPVc5Cw_29	THE ADULTS WERE ADULTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO WATCH IT AND PEOPLE WHO ARE MY AGE AS WELL REALIZE WHAT DID I JUST SEE
BI97DNYfe5I_17	THE ACTION WAS GOOD
k5Y_838nuGo_29	I DONT THINK THAT ANY OF THE PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING ABOUT IT
2WGyTLYerpo_16	ITS A LOT OF FUN
Sqr0AcuoNnk_7	SO I THINK THAT NOTIONS ATTACHED WAS BETTER THAN FRIENDS BENEFITS
_dI--eQ6qVU_18	AND ADD SOMETHING LIKE AN EXTRA SPARK IN THEIR
vyB00TXsimI_18	SO YES I REALLY ENJOYED IT
c5xsKMxpXnc_15	YOU DONT SEE WHY THE STRUCTURE THERE BECAUSE THERE ARE SHOWN IN THE MOVIE
cXypl4FnoZo_1	WHEN YOU SEE RED RIDING HOOD FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND
6Egk_28TtTM_11	AND SO I SEE WHY I WOULD BE SCARED IS BECAUSE I WOULD FEEL SCARED AND KIND OF SAD IF I LOST MY
ZAIRrfG22O0_4	BUT AFTER AN HOUR I JUST SAID ENOUGH I HAD TO WALK OUT THE
atnd_PF-Lbs_20	WHAT ARE YEAH WELL YEAH SAYING THAT TO SHEEN TO SCENES DOZENS AND HEAR UNIQUE IS A BIT HARSH
VbQk4H8hgr0_13	THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL THE SAME AND
9J25DZhivz8_9	THE VOICE ACTING AND THIS WAS INCREDIBLE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_2	IM NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU IT WASNT GOOD
VCslbP0mgZI_3	AL LAND OR WHATEVER IF THEY CAME OUT AND I NEVER SAW
5W7Z1C_fDaE_1	PROBABLY ONE OF THE BALL C S FILMS AT SUNDANCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN
2WGyTLYerpo_41	HES GETS DEVELOPED MORE AS MORE LIKABLE CHARACTERS
WKA5OygbEKI_13	IT HAS SOME REALLY GOOD REFERENCES OF PAST JOHNNY DEPP PHONES IN IT LATE WHILE THE CHAMELEONS GETTING BOUNCED ALONG THE HIGHWAY RUN INTO HUNDREDS THOMPSON
Ci-AH39fi3Y_11	AND THE OTHER ONE WAS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
zhpQhgha_KU_28	YEAH I MEAN IT HAS SOME FUN MOMENTS
9qR7uwkblbs_32	GOOD MOVIE REALLY GOOD SOUNDTRACK
6_0THN4chvY_9	BECAUSE HE SAYS ISSUE AND I THINK HES SAYING THAT YOU
OQvJTdtJ2H4_7	THEY PRETEND LIKE GOING TO BE THIS BIG SCENE IT MAY BE LESS ABOUT A MINUTE AND I WAS LIKE JANET
Oz06ZWiO20M_21	AND THATS WHAT TRADITIONAL NARRATIVE MOVIES DO
POKffnXeBds_11	I MEAN THE MOVIE WAS A WASTE OF TIME
G6GlGvlkxAQ_1	I WILL PUT MONEY ON IT THAT HES GOING TO BE THE BLOCKBUSTER HIT OF THE SUMMER IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE MOVIES
bvLlb-M3UXU_6	NOT A COMPLICATED STORY BUT
VbQk4H8hgr0_44	IT WAS BORING
8OtFthrtaJM_11	I WAS JUST WAITING FOR JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT TO COME OUT JUST JUMP OUT AT ANY TIME AND SAY ITS A PARADOX
7JsX8y1ysxY_19	AND THERES A VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_29	AND THE ACTORS DO SUCH A GOOD JOB OF CARRYING OUT THEIR PARTICULAR ARCS
c7UH_rxdZv4_11	STILL KIND OF COOL
vvZ4IcEtiZc_5	BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF GREAT MOVIES OUT THIS YEAR SO
9T9Hf74oK10_24	YOU DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHATS GOING ON
vyB00TXsimI_2	IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE THAT HAS ANYTHING REALISTIC IN IT YOU SHOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS INSANE
yDtzw_Y-7RU_12	WERE JUST REALLY DOESNT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO US TODAY AT ALL
0h-zjBukYpk_22	I THOUGHT HE MADE A GOOD ACTOR FOR THE DEADPOOL CHARACTER
9qR7uwkblbs_24	ITS KIND OF SAD ABOUT THAT
VCslbP0mgZI_11	SEPT ZACKS SNYDER HERE IS MAKING A MOVIE THATS OSTENSIBLY ABOUT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT BUT ITS A MOVIE ABOUT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT WHICH INCLUDES A LOT OF SLAPPING THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF WOMEN AND BOOZE DAS THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF VIOLENCE DONE AGAINST WOMEN ULTIMATELY WHICH MOST WOMEN END UP COMPLETELY DISEMPOWERED
W8NXH0Djyww_14	HE DID A WONDERFUL JOB
2WGyTLYerpo_57	BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST VEERS INTO LIKE CLICHE ACTION MOVIE TERRITORY AGAIN NOT
jUzDDGyPkXU_8	THAT NUMBER WAS ANOTHER REALLY COOL THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
k5Y_838nuGo_3	AND I HAVE TO ADMIT ALL RIGHT I LIKE STRUCK A DEAL
BvYR0L6f2Ig_12	BUT THAT MOST OF THE ACTORS WAS SO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE THE POLICE CONFERENCE AND KIMBERLY
W8NXH0Djyww_3	I WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_1	I MEAN IT STARTS OUT REALLY SLOW
aiEXnCPZubE_18	JON HAMM AND SCOTLAND COULD BRING UP YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE INTERESTING CHARACTERS
2iD-tVS8NPw_20	I THINK THERE IS ALSO SOME SORT OF LIKE A TONE WITHIN THE ACTUAL POWERS OF THE GREEN LANTERN HIMSELF IN THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY THINK OUT OF ANYTHING AND IF YOU CAN PROJECT THAT INTO THE REAL LIFE
VbQk4H8hgr0_52	THE MOVIE DID HAVE SOME POINTS FOR I WAS LAUGHING
iiK8YX8oH1E_11	SO I WILL GIVE IT POINTS FOR NOT BEING EXACTLY LIKE MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING EVEN THOUGH THE TRAILER SETS IT UP THAT WAY
OtBXNcAL_lE_11	DONT GET ME WRONG THERE WERE YOU KNOW FUNNY PARTS IN THE MOVIE A
1iG0909rllw_9	AND I I DIDNT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM NAMING IN TERMS OF HIS DIRECTION
G-xst2euQUc_20	HOW MUCH I REALLY DID ENJOY IT SO I WOULD
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_16	DEFINITELY A LITTLE BIT ABOVE AVERAGE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_4	SO I WAS YOU KNOW REALLY HYPED UP
Njd1F0vZSm4_4	AND THE OWLS ARE REALLY WONDERFUL AND
OQvJTdtJ2H4_16	THE BEST PART ABOUT THE MOVIE I GOT A FREE PAIR OF GLASSES
9c67fiY0wGQ_4	I ALSO LIKE TO TELL THE STORY LINE OF THE MOVIE WORK TOGETHER SMOOTHLY
LSi-o-IrDMs_9	I GUESS FOR THIS KIND OF MOVIE THE PLOT IS IS IS THREADBARE THE
cM3Yna7AavY_13	I DIDNT REALLY LIKE BUT RATHER VARY
Qr1Ca94K55A_12	I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GONNA BE MORE THAN THAT BUT ITS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THAT
c5xsKMxpXnc_3	THEY TALK ABOUT FINANCING INSTILLING KISS WHICH IS DUMB
f9O3YtZ2VfI_27	I CALL IT I LIKE THE CAST
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_15	AND IT REALLY JUST LACKED WHAT MADE OUR MOVIES MORE ENJOYABLE
IumbAb8q2dM_7	USUALLY IM NOT REALLY A BIG HUGE SCI FI ALIEN KINDA FAN BUT
Nzq88NnDkEk_13	I FEEL LIKE MY DO SO IT REALLY WASNT THAT SCARY
zhpQhgha_KU_4	I MEAN THAT SOUNDS REALLY HARSH
PZ-lDQFboO8_6	BUT AS FAR AS HUMOR DOES NOT AS MUCH AS I WAS EXPECTING
bvLlb-M3UXU_13	THE SECOND REASON THIS MOVIE WAS MADE AND IN MY OPINION THE REAL REASON IS MADE AGAINST LEICESTER STALLONE TELLING HIMSELF IVE STILL GOT
HEsqda8_d0Q_20	YEAH GENERALLY THE ACCENTS ARE REALLY REALLY GOOD
atnd_PF-Lbs_9	NOW I WONT EVEN TALK ABOUT ACTING BECAUSE ITS JUST SO BAD
cXypl4FnoZo_15	WE HAD LIKE WE I GUESS EVERYBODY JUST LIKE THIS RANDOM CHARACTER DUDE WHO WHAT DOES HE DO
nzpVDcQ0ywM_11	ALL I CAN SAY IS HES A PRETTY AVERAGE GUY
zhpQhgha_KU_12	IT ALSO REALLY DIDNT NEED A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT IT HAD IN IT LIKE
d6hH302o4v8_24	IT WAS VERY VERY VERY BORING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_1	I CANT EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE ADEQUATELY WITHOUT DESCRIBING SOME SPECIFIC THINGS IN THE THIRD ACT OF THE MOVIE WHICH
etzxEpPuc6I_2	THE DUDE AND MADE THE TECHNOLOGIES I CANT BRING THEM WITH
Qr1Ca94K55A_9	I WAS I WAS GOOD
03bSnISJMiM_9	A LOT OF ACTION SHE
0h-zjBukYpk_18	I MEAN IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO TAKE OFF THE COSTUME OR SOMETHING
BI97DNYfe5I_4	BUT IT WAS STILL A GOOD FILM
7JsX8y1ysxY_23	THAT WAS VERY COOL
BXuRRbG0Ugk_13	BUT IF THATS ALL YOURE LOOKING FOR YOULL ACTUALLY MISSED THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_24	OF THE AUSTIN GREAT OF A DEAL WITH THE BACKSTORY OF JANE FOSTER RIGHT NOW THE PORTMAN AND HER CREW AND HOW THEY RELATE TO FOR
LSi-o-IrDMs_15	I HAD IDEAL SEATS BECAUSE
_dI--eQ6qVU_22	I JUST REALLY ENJOYED IT
vyB00TXsimI_22	AND THERE ACTUALLY WAS ONE SCENE THAT I FOUND
d3_k5Xpfmik_2	BASICALLY
tIrG4oNLFzE_11	RIGHT GRUMPY LET AND THEN MAYBE EVEN WHEN SHES HAPPY BUT SHE WOULDNT FROWN HANNAH AND FROWNED HER EYEBROWS THING WHICH IS TO BE HOW TO BUT I YEAH RIGHT
I5y0__X72p0_10	I MEAN I DONT REGRET SAYING IT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_13	VOICE ACTING WAS PHENOMENAL
TvyZBvOMOTc_5	ALTHOUGH I ENJOYED THE MOVIE
OtBXNcAL_lE_2	THIS MOVIE IS DUMB
Iu2PFX3z_1s_10	BUT I THINK ITS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT SO UNIQUE
k5Y_838nuGo_13	AND IT JUST WAS BETTER MAYBE IS THE BABY
bOL9jKpeJRs_32	FOR THE MOST PART IT IS A FAMILY FRIENDLY WARM AND FUZZY MOVIE WILL
73jzhE8R1TQ_18	I DONT THINK SO THANK YOU KNOW ITS JUST ONE OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT MATTER GIVE FOR SOME REASON THE NINETY
jUzDDGyPkXU_10	DESIGN THE ALIENS IN A REALLY COOL UNIQUE WAY TO MAKE THEM LIKE BIONIC BUT ALSO MECHANICAL
QN9ZIUWUXsY_10	ITS A BIT OF A MIXED BAG IS THERE SOME VERY BRIGHT MOMENTS
WKA5OygbEKI_9	WELL ITS A JOHNNY DEPP MOVIES I WAS ENTERTAINING BUT
TvyZBvOMOTc_13	SEEM TO BE REALLY ENJOY THEMSELVES WHOLE WAY THROUGH
BioHAh1qJAQ_26	WHEN YOUR PLANE FINDS THESE THINGS WHATEVER THEY ARE THEY ARE STILL WISE AND NOW HES KIND OF LIKE NOT BEING THAT I THINK ABOUT IT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_4	IN SOME WAYS THE FIRST ONE WAS PRESENT
dq3Nf_lMPnE_12	IT SEEMS LIKE THE WRITERS AND CREATORS TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT
v0zCBqDeKcE_8	JIM CAREY YOU WERE MY GRAND HERE THE TWO OF THEM
Clx4VXItLTE_5	SO I THINK IM LIKE IMMUNE TO THEM
tmZoasNr4rU_3	I COULDNT GET INTO IT
Clx4VXItLTE_11	AND SO THE ACTION IS A LITTLE BIT LATE OH MY GOD YOU WOULDNT REALLY DO THAT WELL
VbQk4H8hgr0_29	BUT ON THIS ONE JUST AS THEY WERE WITH SPIDER MAN
Af8D0E4ZXaw_25	IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH
8qrpnFRGt2A_10	THIS MOVIE THIS MOVIE BUT HALFWAY THROUGH I WAS CHECKING THE TIME AND SAW THAT THIS MOVIE IS TWO HOURS LONG
vvZ4IcEtiZc_11	BECAUSE ITS ITS AN AUDIENCE PLEASER YOU KNOW
Bfr499ggo-0_3	BACK IF YOURE LUCKY IF YOU READ AND YOU ARE HER LIFE CAN STOP THE FIRST MOVIE ONE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_12	WELL WELL HAVE YOU CREEPED OUT YOUR INNER CORE WITH THE TINY LITTLE SMILE
f_pcplsH_V0_12	I REMEMBER THE STAFF MOVIES BASED ON THE SCREEN MOVIES THE THE CITY IN UNIVERSE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD COMMENT ON THE KILLERS REACTING THE MOVIES OR THE MOVIES WELL IN THE FIRST DOES BECOME A WAY THE WAY WAY TOO MUCH OF A PLOT POINT BASICALLY
0h-zjBukYpk_9	YOU KNOW NOTHING GRADES
rnaNMUZpvvg_15	SO IM VERY HE WAS JUST LIKE A PLOT DEVICE FOR THIS OTHER GUY TO START ACTING LIKE A FATHER FIGURE AND IT WAS JUST STUPID BUT THEY DIDNT EVEN ACT QUALITY TOWARDS HIM HE
iiK8YX8oH1E_8	I THINK ITS PREDICTABLE UP INTO A POINT
wMbj6ajWbic_3	FOUR OF THE COLLECTOR OF THE ACTION FIGURES
ZUXBRvtny7o_17	I MEAN THE PLOT IS LIKE DRY NIGHT WITH SOME SCI FI WITH SOME ACTION WAIT LIKABLE CHARACTERS IF THAT IF THAT IS IMPORTANT GUYS
Jkswaaud0hk_2	GORGEOUS
1iG0909rllw_17	THE BEST THE MOST THREATENING IT READ EVER ALL THE SAME SEVERAL
bOL9jKpeJRs_24	A LITTLE AWKWARD
tStelxIAHjw_4	I THINK IM GETTING TO THAT POINT WHERE IM JUST TRYING TO ENTERTAIN RIGHT DISNEY PIXAR MOVIES ANYMORE BECAUSE I COULDNT AND
GWuJjcEuzt8_17	THIS ONE YOU KNOW PROBABLY IN THE MIDDLE SO THREE POINT FIVE STARS IN
BXuRRbG0Ugk_5	AND THAT DESCRIBES COWBOYS AND ALIENS PRETTY WELL
BioHAh1qJAQ_1	BECAUSE IM A BIG FAN OF THE FIRST FIVE
Njd1F0vZSm4_10	YOU CANT TELL WHICH ARE THE GOOD ONES WHICH I
ob23OKe5a9Q_7	IF THATS THE CASE THEN YOU SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU REALLY LIKE CHEESY JOKES PREDICTABLE MOVIES BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A PERFECT FAMILY MOVIE
BioHAh1qJAQ_30	AND ITS LIKE YOUR PROGRAM OKAY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD USING REAL PEOPLE ITS THE WORST WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT READ SOME COMPUTER SYSTEM SOMEWHERE AND THATS MADE SOME
cM3Yna7AavY_5	AND OH MY GOSH I WAS BLOWN AWAY
dq3Nf_lMPnE_7	BUT ALSO NOT VERY ORIGINAL SHREK
Oz06ZWiO20M_9	ITS NOT BAD IN THE WAY I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE BAD

8d-gEyoeBzc_10	I WOULD SAY THAT THERES AT LEAST GOOD FOR THOSE FULL CHARACTERS IN MAN
8OtFthrtaJM_7	THANKS A LOT COMMERCIAL
Vj1wYRQjB-o_7	THE ACTION THEY DO HAVE IS REALLY WELL DONE
2iD-tVS8NPw_5	IS A MOVIE THAT YOURE GONNA GO OUT AND SEE
aiEXnCPZubE_22	THEY ARE INTERESTING CHARACTERS AND
X3j2zQgwYgE_5	BUT ITS REALLY NOT WONDERFUL NOTHING
7JsX8y1ysxY_35	A WARNING TO VERY VERY DARK
Iu2PFX3z_1s_8	NO IT ISNT A GREAT FANTASTIC TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT IT KIND OF MOVIE
wMbj6ajWbic_17	AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS IN
Jkswaaud0hk_14	STORYLINE WAS OKAY
cXypl4FnoZo_2	AND I JUST SAY LIKE OVERALL IF THEY THINK IT WAS GOOD
I5y0__X72p0_29	IT VISUALLY ITS KIND OF COOL HOW THEY SHOW HER CONFUSION BECAUSE SHE GROWS UP IN THE WOODS
Sqr0AcuoNnk_4	AND THERE ARE TIMES THAT I WAS JUST SITTING THERE AFTER THEY SAID THEIR JOKES AND I WAS LIKE THATS NOT NOBODYS LAUGHING THATS NOT FUNNY
BI97DNYfe5I_14	PLAYED KATO PERFECTLY AND
2WGyTLYerpo_15	GAVE ME CHILLS
Clx4VXItLTE_28	I THINK THATS HOW THEY COPE WITH GETTING JUST LIKE SCARED AND JUMPS AND STUFF
VbQk4H8hgr0_10	ITS NOTHING MAJOR NOTHING
6Egk_28TtTM_12	BUT IT ALSO TURNS OUT GREAT
ZAIRrfG22O0_7	IF YOU DONT LIKE THAT TYPE OF MOVIE THEN I REALLY DONT THINK YOURE GONNA LIKE THIS AT ALL
Oz06ZWiO20M_22	THIS MOVIE IS REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE THE PLOT IS WHAT LITTLE THERE IS
OQvJTdtJ2H4_4	IT WAS VERY HARD TO FOLLOW
2WGyTLYerpo_42	YOU CAN CARE ABOUT HIM
WKA5OygbEKI_10	ITS NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD GO FIVE
MLal-t_vJPM_8	ITS BEAUTIFULLY DONE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_12	THE GREAT PLOT WAS WITH HOFFMAN TYING UP ALL LOOSE ENDS AND STUFF
9qR7uwkblbs_31	I KNEW THAT IN SECTION THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE DREAMIN
9qR7uwkblbs_9	IF I CAN SPOIL ANYTHING FOR YOU JUST BECAUSE LIKE THAT WOULD BE RUDE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_1	YES WHEN YOU HEAR JOHNNY DEPP YOU THINK THIS MOVIE HAS TO BE GOOD
5W7Z1C_fDaE_2	SEVEN I WAS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS FILM ITS BIG
vyB00TXsimI_1	BUT I DO WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT PRIEST
yDtzw_Y-7RU_11	THEREFORE A LOT OF THE SOCIAL COMMENTARY GOES OVER YOUR HEAD

POKffnXeBds_12	TWO GIRLS TRYING TOO HARD
VbQk4H8hgr0_47	THE SECOND VEHICLE WAS REALLY GREAT
8OtFthrtaJM_12	NOW THE ONLY SUSPENSEFUL PART THAT I FOUND IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MATT DAMON FIRST DISCOVERS THE BUREAU IN THE FIRST PLACE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_11	I THINK THE SECOND ONE
8d-gEyoeBzc_29	I DIDNT REALLY FAILED THE INCLUSION OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NECESSARY
9qR7uwkblbs_27	COMEDY ROMANTIC ROM COM
VCslbP0mgZI_12	SO OKAY IF ZACK SNYDER WERE A WOMAN I WOULD SAY OKAY SHES MAKING A COMMENT ABOUT THE WAY WOMEN CAN BE EMPOWERED IN MALE DOMINATED SOCIETIES IN THE WAY MAN DISTRACTED IT HURT AND DAMAGE WOMEN AND PREVENT THEM FROM ASSERTING WHO THEY REALLY ARE
W8NXH0Djyww_17	LIKE THIS MOVIE HAD GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES
2WGyTLYerpo_54	I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF STUPID
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_15	I THINK IT WAS AN OKAY MOVIE
POKffnXeBds_3	YEAH SHE HAD A FAT  IN TERMS OF WHITE GIRLS WELL IM IN HER  REALLY ISNT THAT BAD
etzxEpPuc6I_18	THERE WAS PARTS THESE ARE SEEN SOME CREATIVE THIS IS WHEN WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_7	EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
Njd1F0vZSm4_7	THIS STORY IS VERY DARK
OQvJTdtJ2H4_15	TO DO SO IS WAY DIFFERENT FROM PERCY JACKSON AND RANDOM LAWS WHICH
iiK8YX8oH1E_12	JENNIFER GOODWIN IS FUN TO WATCH
OtBXNcAL_lE_12	I JUST DONT CARE FOR THE PLOT
2iD-tVS8NPw_23	YOU DONT ENTIRELY KNOW WHATS COMING NEXT
VbQk4H8hgr0_51	TO BE FAIR BECAUSE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_2	BUT OVERALL AND TO GO SEE IT
IumbAb8q2dM_4	I SUGGESTED YOU GUYS GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_16	SUFFERS FROM WHAT I CALL THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN SYNDROME WHERE IT BUILDS TOO MUCH FOR THESE HUGE CATASTROPHIC WAR SEQUENCES ARE SUPPOSED TO BLOW YOU AWAY BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU DONT GIVE A DAMN BECAUSE IT JUST LACKS THAT CHARM OF THE PAST MOVIES
Qr1Ca94K55A_11	AND SOME REALLY COOL GUN FIGHTS
f9O3YtZ2VfI_24	BUT ITS ITS LIKE SOMEONE MADE YOU A KICK  SANDWICH BUT IF A MAN IS ON IT AND YOU DONT LIKE MAYONNAISE ITS NOT LIKE TOMATO OR LETTUCE WHERE YOU CAN PICK AT ALL NO ITS GOT ITS MAN ASIAN IS ALL OVER EVERYTHING AND NOW YOURE STUCK WITH THIS KICK  SANDWICH IT WOULD BE KICK  IF THEY DID NOT MANAGE ON IT BUT AS A MAN IS ON IT OR YOU GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH
7JsX8y1ysxY_9	IT WAS FUNNY THOUGH
9c67fiY0wGQ_7	THEIR CELLS AND SIMILAR TO HOW A PERSON WITH THAT
ZUXBRvtny7o_9	ANYWAYS DOMESTIC ISSUE IT
cM3Yna7AavY_10	I PERSONALLY I LIKE ATLANTIS
bvLlb-M3UXU_10	THE FIRST REASON IS THE OBVIOUS JUST TO MAKE OF EXCITING ENJOYABLE ACTION FILM
HEsqda8_d0Q_23	I WAS CHOSEN TO GO SEE THAT
zhpQhgha_KU_7	A FEW FUNNY PARTS
PZ-lDQFboO8_5	NOW IM NOT GONNA LIE THERE ARE A FEW PARTS THAT HAVE GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES NOT EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN ANIMATED FILM IT DID HAVE SOME GREAT FIGHT SCENES
Nzq88NnDkEk_10	I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A RUSHED MOVIE
9T9Hf74oK10_3	I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY SPLIT ABOUT THIS MOVIE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_12	I DONT REALLY FEEL ANY EMOTIONAL PULL FROM HIM IN THIS MOVIE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_28	SO YOU KNOW THAT WAS A LITTLE SURPRISING I GUESS
zhpQhgha_KU_11	I JUST PERSONALLY I JUST DIDNT REALLY ENJOY IT
d6hH302o4v8_27	I HATED IT
Oz06ZWiO20M_18	ITS FUNNY DIALOGUE MAKE
cXypl4FnoZo_16	I DONT KNOW HOW TO LIKE TELL YOU IS THAT YOU BEING LIKE THAT DOESNT NARROW IT DOWN AT ALL
2WGyTLYerpo_9	BUT AGAIN YOU CANT EXPECT A HUGE LIKE CEREBRAL MIND BENDER FROM MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS THE
7JsX8y1ysxY_20	I TELL YOU WHO MADE THE MOVIE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_10	WHEN I SAW THE FIRST TRAILER BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY SHOT UP NEAR THE TOP OF MY LIST OF MUST SEE MOVIES FOR TWENTY ELEVEN THE FINAL
G6GlGvlkxAQ_27	STILL HE LEARNED FROM THE EARTHLINGS
LSi-o-IrDMs_16	ITS GOOD TO SIT RIGHT IN THE THEATER WITH THREE D AND
c7UH_rxdZv4_28	HE WAS THE ONLY CHARACTER THOUGH SLIGHTLY INTERESTING
BI97DNYfe5I_7	AND BECAUSE OF THAT I WAS EXPECTING SETH ROGAN TO MAYBE TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS BUT HE WASNT BUT
rnaNMUZpvvg_3	I HAD EXPECTED TO BE GOOD
Af8D0E4ZXaw_2	I BELIEVE THAT A SUCCESSFUL GREEN LANTERN MOVIE WOULD LEAD WARNER BROTHERS TO ADAPT THE FLASH AND WONDER WOMAN AMONG POSSIBLY OTHERS
etzxEpPuc6I_1	SO CHANNING TATUM AND MARLIN ARE TRANSPORTING IT THEY GET AMBUSHED BY I THINK ITS COBRA IS KIND OF HARD TO EXPLAIN BECAUSE
jUzDDGyPkXU_13	BUT ITS NOT ALWAYS QUITE EXPLAINED YOU KNOW LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HOST
TvyZBvOMOTc_6	IF I THINK HONESTLY THE PLOT WASNT THAT GREAT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_10	ITS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES WHERE MOST OF THE FUNNY PARTS ARE IN THE COMMERCIAL FIGURE LIKE THAT WE HAVE TO BE AWESOME WHEN YOU GO IN YOU KNOW YOUVE SEEN THE COMMERCIAL SO WE KIND OF GOT PRETTY NEW AND FUNNY ANYMORE AND IF YOURE WONDERING WHERE THE HELL IS THE REST OF IT IT
Iu2PFX3z_1s_13	IN YOUR FACE
OtBXNcAL_lE_1	AND A GUY WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE TOM CRUISE
k5Y_838nuGo_10	IT IS LIKE THE FOURTH ONE QUITE A BIT
bOL9jKpeJRs_31	THERE ARE PARTS THAT ARE VERY
tIrG4oNLFzE_12	WHICH IT WAS VERY ANNOYED ME
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_8	ESTATE NAME MY EXPECTATIONS WERE LOWERED BECAUSE OF ALL THESE REVIEWS BUT I REALLY DIDNT HATE IT
I5y0__X72p0_13	ANYWAY AS SKIPPING CLASS THAT SHES GOT THIS LIKE KICK IT OUT OF SEARED
_dI--eQ6qVU_21	IT ENGAGES THE AUDIENCE MORE
vyB00TXsimI_21	I LAUGHED AT QUITE A BIT OF THE DIALOGUE
6Egk_28TtTM_9	RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE MY BROTHER IS FIVE YEARS OLD AND SEE I THINK THIS IS A SCARY AT ALL
d3_k5Xpfmik_1	SINCE HE WAS NAMED THEMSELVES AFTER THE PLACES AND TO IT FOR TRAVELING WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY NICE TOUCH M AS
atnd_PF-Lbs_19	IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS SAME SICK NOWADAYS
Clx4VXItLTE_12	ALL MOVIES TO SAY WHAT IS A PODCAST AND
Af8D0E4ZXaw_26	I DONT EVEN KNOW WHERE I REALLY SHOULD BEGIN WHEN LISTING OFF THE NEGATIVES BUT IM GOING TO START A FEW THE SUPERFICIAL THINGS
9J25DZhivz8_24	I ALWAYS THINK ITS HILARIOUS
dq3Nf_lMPnE_11	AND THEIR PLACE IS A RUN OF THE MILL ANIMATED ACTION ADVENTURE PLOT WITH A FEW CHUCKLES THROWN IN
Clx4VXItLTE_6	THE ONLY MUSLIM IM REALLY SCARED ABOUT THIS SMALL SOLDIERS
BvYR0L6f2Ig_7	AND BUT SOME OF THE PLUS PLUS THANK YOU MAY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE WHATS YOUR WRONG ACTUALLY ISOLATED
QN9ZIUWUXsY_13	WHAT IT LACKS IN THOSE AREAS IN MOST DEFINITELY MAKES UP FOR JUST LIKE SHEER VISUAL SPECTACLE
TvyZBvOMOTc_10	YOU KNOW THE WHOLE MOVIE IS BASED ON WHETHER SHE GOT SOMEONE IN TIME YOURE NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE GETS THERE
BioHAh1qJAQ_25	IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE
2WGyTLYerpo_39	FIRST YOU JUST KIND OF LIKE A GRUMPY OLD GUY BUT
1iG0909rllw_14	HOWEVER IT IS LOYALTY TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE THAT GIVES IT ITS FOOLS MAKE A
bOL9jKpeJRs_27	YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE EXPENDABLES EVEN THOUGH CAME OUT SUCH A LONG TIME AGO THERE
tStelxIAHjw_7	I LIKE QUALITY
ZUXBRvtny7o_14	INTENDING WORKS REALLY REALLY GREAT TO
Jkswaaud0hk_1	I MEAN I COULD S AND JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE I THOUGHT THEY MADE A GREAT DEAL MILA KUNIS SHE
f_pcplsH_V0_11	THE FIRST HOUR THAT MUCH THOUGH
rnaNMUZpvvg_16	BUT YOURE ACTUALLY A COMPLETE DOUCHE BAG JUST
8qrpnFRGt2A_13	THE THIS IS ME
vvZ4IcEtiZc_12	AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ROMANTIC DRAMAS LIKE ITS ALL RIGHT IT GETS THE AUDIENCES TO THEATERS BECAUSE ITS A COMPELLING IDEA BUT ITS BEEN ON
5W7Z1C_fDaE_11	JOHN GOODMAN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING MELISSA
Nzq88NnDkEk_8	BEING A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL I WAS I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IT BUT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_30	ACTINGS NOT THAT BAD BUT
cM3Yna7AavY_6	ANYWAY YOU CAN SEE IM STILL SPEECHLESS THIS MOVIE WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL
dq3Nf_lMPnE_4	THEY SOLVE THIS DILEMMA BY REMOVING THE PAST WITH THEM ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE TWIST COURTESY OF NEW BADDIE RUMPELSTILTSKIN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED AND
BXuRRbG0Ugk_6	SO I GUESS I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT IT TURNED OUT AS GOOD AS IT DID BECAUSE
GWuJjcEuzt8_14	YOU KNOW IT MATCHES THE WHOLE THEME OF THE MOVIE YOU KNOW CABARET AND YOU KNOW THE WORKS
BioHAh1qJAQ_2	I THOUGHT THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO HAVE A TRANSSEXUAL BECAUSE
HEsqda8_d0Q_19	THE NEXT CONSOLE VS EIGHT KNOWING THIS FACTOR THAT
Njd1F0vZSm4_13	ARE YOU CAN SEE APPTIO
ob23OKe5a9Q_4	FOR EXAMPLE
VbQk4H8hgr0_9	IT WAS A FEW JOKES OKAY YEAH THAT MAKE YOU GIGGLE OR SOMETHING BUT
phBUpBr1hSo_10	YES THIS MOVIE SEEMED A LITTLE LONG
8d-gEyoeBzc_13	YOU KNOW WELL DRAWN OUT CHARACTER
d6hH302o4v8_31	LIKE WAS LIKE SPEWING CGR CLASS AT OUR READ LIKE
tIrG4oNLFzE_2	ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS AND
GWuJjcEuzt8_1	FIRST THINGS FIRST CHRISTINA AGUILERAS PIPES I SPREAD THE UPDATE THAT
phBUpBr1hSo_1	WHAT IS THIS MOVIE VERY VERY EXCITED
2iD-tVS8NPw_19	AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO GO THAT ROUTE BUT
wMbj6ajWbic_14	SUMMER WAS KIND OF LEAD ACTIVITIES IF YOU ASK ME
Jkswaaud0hk_17	I CERTAINLY CAN MORE OF A DATE MOVIE THEN I SING ALONE UNLESS
2iD-tVS8NPw_6	AND YOU WANT TO SEE IT IN THREE D BECAUSE I
aiEXnCPZubE_21	AND WHICH HURTS THE FILM DRASTICALLY BECAUSE
7JsX8y1ysxY_36	AND THERES NOT IN MY OPINION THERE WASNT VERY MUCH OF A BALANCE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL KIND OF THING
X3j2zQgwYgE_6	RUSSIA HAVENT SEEN
G-xst2euQUc_19	I WAS THOROUGHLY SURPRISED
Vj1wYRQjB-o_4	I WOULDNT WANT THAT POINT IT MAY
8OtFthrtaJM_4	I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE
BioHAh1qJAQ_13	AND FOR ONCE SAN FRAN ENTERS THE GREAT YOU KNOW THE SOUND TRACK DRAWS YOU IN
nbWiPyCm4g0_2	IT REACHED NEW HEIGHTS OF HORRENDOUS
9J25DZhivz8_12	K I WAS LISTENING FOR
nzpVDcQ0ywM_3	ITS REALLY GLOSSED OVER WITH LOTS OF STUNNING SPECIAL EFFECTS AND BIG EXPLOSIONS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_10	AND SECONDLY BECAUSE ITS A MARVEL GEEK I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY FAIR SHARE OF DISAPPOINTMENTS OVER THE LAST DECADE AND I CAN GENUINELY SUPPORT
Clx4VXItLTE_24	SO EVERYONE LIKE EVERYONE THAT CINEMA WAS KIND MADE ME BECAUSE
vyB00TXsimI_17	AND THERES A BETTER ON TOP OF THE TRAIN FIGHT THAN THE FIRST MISSION IMPOSSIBLE MOVIE
_dI--eQ6qVU_17	BUT WHEN THEY FIGURE OUT A NEW WAY TO INTERPRET THIS
I5y0__X72p0_25	ITS A GOOD ACTION MOVIE ITS LIKE
2WGyTLYerpo_19	THE ONE THING I LIKED THE ALIENS IS THAT A THEYRE NOT JUST LIKE WEAKLINGS TO HIDE BEHIND THE TECHNOLOGY TO
k5Y_838nuGo_26	ITS GREAT
BI97DNYfe5I_18	I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU GO SEE IN THEATERS
lXPQBPVc5Cw_26	I DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANY MORE OF THIS
jUzDDGyPkXU_25	ALL RIGHT AND MOVING ON THERES NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN THIS MOVIE NONE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_8	I WAS NOT BORED DURING NO STRINGS ATTACHED
ZUXBRvtny7o_34	SO YEAH IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN THIS WEEKEND WELL WHAT DO YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE
d3_k5Xpfmik_10	ITS BASICALLY A S SLOW MOTION SHOWCASE DIFFERENT EVENTS
cW1FSBF59ik_10	I LOVE YOU AS AN ACTOR BASED ON HIS LOOKS AT THE ACTUAL TALENTED ACTORS NO
1DmNV9C1hbY_13	NUMBER OTHERWISE I DONT KNOW
bvLlb-M3UXU_9	THIS MOVIE ESSENTIALLY WAS MADE FOR THREE REASONS IN MY OPINION
LSi-o-IrDMs_20	SOMETIMES TREATY CAN MESS UP THE COLOR AT LEAST THE OLD ANAGLYPH THREE D I THINK REALTY YEAH YOU KNOW I HAD SORT OF THAT HAS SORT OF TAINTED THAT LENDS ITSELF ITS ALSO NOT IDEAL FOR FOR THE IMAGE ITSELF
G6GlGvlkxAQ_11	THANKS VERY WELL TO ESTABLISH THE CHARACTER FOR
BXuRRbG0Ugk_26	AND THE CAST IS PRETTY WELL ROUNDED OUT WITH SUPPORTING PERFORMANCES FROM GUYS LIKE SAM ROCKWELL AS THE DOCK
7JsX8y1ysxY_16	LOOK FOR
OQvJTdtJ2H4_8	AND THEN ITS DEFINITELY NOT A THREE D MOVIE
6_0THN4chvY_6	THEY GOT GREAT JOKES
cXypl4FnoZo_20	I WISH WE WISH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GUY
f9O3YtZ2VfI_2	THE VERY INTERESTING IDEA AND
tStelxIAHjw_16	I LOVE YOU GUYS
9J25DZhivz8_6	THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST THREE D MOVIE IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY USED THREE D THREE STORY
9qR7uwkblbs_5	I THINK THAT THEY PERSONALLY THOUGHT RACHEL WHITEHURST REALLY  LOVE SUITS AND RYAN GOSLING SO THEY MADE THIS MOVIE WITH ME IN MIND LIKE
d6hH302o4v8_11	I WAS SEEN THROUGH TO SLEEPING
aiEXnCPZubE_1	IS MEDIOCRE IN A ROLE
zhpQhgha_KU_27	[UNK]
nzpVDcQ0ywM_24	HE DELIVERS A LOT OF INTENSITY
MLal-t_vJPM_4	IF YOU DONT HAVE KIDS YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER SEEING IT ANYWAY
1iG0909rllw_6	IT WAS ENJOYABLE I WAS
73jzhE8R1TQ_2	IT WASNT LIKE IT DOESNT LIKE ALL THE BOOK WAS SO MAKE SURE TO MOVIE
etzxEpPuc6I_14	BUT IT THEN THEY THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS JUST A MOVIE ABOUT IT A DOMINANT SIT AND TAKE IT SERIOUSLY I
BXuRRbG0Ugk_30	COWBOYS AND ALIENS PROBLEM IS THE SCREEN PLAY SIX
aiEXnCPZubE_17	HER CHARACTER IS ALSO UNDEVELOPED IN WEEK
PZ-lDQFboO8_10	I LOVE THE SHREK FILMS
wMbj6ajWbic_22	DOT LIFE BABY TICKLER JOS JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT HAD A LOT OF FLOWERS HIS ROLE
jUzDDGyPkXU_7	I DIDNT REALLY SEE A COMPARISON OF BLACK HAWK DOWN TO LIKE THE VERY VERY END
2WGyTLYerpo_58	HUGE FLAW BUT ITS THERE AND ITS NOTICEABLE OVERALL
zhpQhgha_KU_31	BUT LIKE I SAID IF YOU LIKE IT YOURE FREE TO GO SEE IT I JUST WASNT THAT INTO IT
8d-gEyoeBzc_25	PREDATORS REALLY WELL PACED MOVIE AND
atnd_PF-Lbs_6	I AM I HAVE TO WATCH THE FIRST TWO AGAIN OR MAYBE JUST THE FIRST ONE TO STABILIZE MY THOUGHTS ON THE SERIES
PZ-lDQFboO8_9	MAYBE BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME THREE WORDS BUT FOR THIS ONE FOR ME IT IS WASNT ALL I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE
1DmNV9C1hbY_2	I LOVED THE VERY FIRST ALBUM THE CHIPMUNKS MOVIE BECAUSE
I5y0__X72p0_33	THE SOUNDTRACK WAS INTERESTING
I5y0__X72p0_2	AT FIRST WHEN I SAW THE PREVIEWS I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE STUPID TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
8qrpnFRGt2A_25	I MEAN ITS ITS ABOUT NOT LOCAL STORE OR
IumbAb8q2dM_8	IT WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD
rnaNMUZpvvg_20	YOU LOOK AWESOME WHILE HE DID IT BUT YEAH OKAY SO LIKE ALL THE GIRLS WHO WENT ALL DISAGREE WITH MEETING DOESNT MASON MOVIE BUT THEY ALL THINK IS AMAZING BECAUSE THEY WERE STARING AT DANIEL CRAIG GOLD IM GOING ON MY GOSH HES SO HOT
ZUXBRvtny7o_22	I READ IT THIS MORNING
LSi-o-IrDMs_6	THE ACTING IS BAD THE
ZUXBRvtny7o_5	YES I HAD A GOOD TIME
7JsX8y1ysxY_5	PEOPLE WERE LIKE EATING POPCORN AND YOU SEE THE FIRST CHARLEMAINE PEOPLE IF YOURE LIKE US THIS RIPPLE EFFECT OF WHISPERING ALL MY GOD IS THAT IS IT IN MY LOOKING RIGHT IT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_30	I JESUS I DONT KNOW IT WAS ITS SAD THOUGH BECAUSE I EXPECTED SO MUCH MORE
d6hH302o4v8_1	THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_28	BUT AND ITS A GOOD STORY
k5Y_838nuGo_30	YEAH ITS ITS BETTER THAN THEIR OWN ABSOLUTELY
bOL9jKpeJRs_11	I WAS JUST REALLY PROTECTIVE
f_pcplsH_V0_2	BUT ARE EXPECTED PROBLEMS UP
1iG0909rllw_22	BUT THEN THE SAME GRACEFUL FOCUSES AT WOODS AND TAYLOR LAUTNER AS JACOB THE JEWELER FROWNING ON MONDAY NIGHT AND I FOUND
c7UH_rxdZv4_24	HE WAS STILL BORING
Qr1Ca94K55A_6	IT MADE IT HYSTERICAL AND IT WAS JUST FUNNY WITH ALL HIS LITTLE ONE LINERS THAT HE HAD IN
9T9Hf74oK10_11	AND I THINK THAT THE MOVIE DID RELY ON YOU TO KIND OF FIGURE IT OUT AND KIND OF DEAL WITH THOSE IDEAS BY YOURSELF
0h-zjBukYpk_17	AND HE ALMOST LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS HIS CHARACTER IN DEFIANCE
03bSnISJMiM_6	MORE AND
MLal-t_vJPM_11	ONE IM GETTING A LITTLE SICK OF THE MICHAEL CERA KIND OF LEAD CHARACTER IS SORT OF REALLY AWKWARD BOY WHO IS REALLY AWKWARD AND STUFF YOU KNOW IM GETTING SICK OF THAT CHARACTER AND IM TIRED OF THEM AND
X3j2zQgwYgE_10	BE FOREWARNED THOUGH EXPECTATIONS
Ci-AH39fi3Y_24	BUT THE END WAS REALLY YOU KNOW
2WGyTLYerpo_5	THE ONLY OSCAR I COULD EVEN THINK OF IS MAYBE LIKE BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY
Oz06ZWiO20M_14	I KNOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND SILLY BECAUSE ITS SUCH A BROAD GOOFY MAINSTREAM COLD KIND OF MOVIE BUT
v0zCBqDeKcE_7	GENIUS I MEAN SOME PEOPLE LIKE JAMES WOODS I BELIEVE HIS I Q IS ONE ONE EIGHTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Nzq88NnDkEk_30	AND BUT I GOTTA I GOTTA DO MY DUTY AND LET YOU GUYS KNOW ITS OF MAJOR SURFACED
VbQk4H8hgr0_26	IF YOURE HOPING IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND YOURE FORCED TO GO WHICH PROBABLY WILL IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU KNOW PUT UP WITH IT AS A PARENT BUT
atnd_PF-Lbs_15	ITS ALREADY GOT ADDITION ONE MIGHT NOT SOUND ALL THAT UNIQUE
03bSnISJMiM_12	BUT IT WAS REALLY REALLY AWESOME
BioHAh1qJAQ_29	FOR SOME KIND OF FREAKY TELEPORTATION OR WHATEVER
HEsqda8_d0Q_3	AND I ACTUALLY LIKES THE FILM A LAW AND I
WKA5OygbEKI_6	ITS NOT HIS BEST
v0zCBqDeKcE_11	AND JIM CAREY I KIND OF WENT OFF I LOVE UP I USED TO IMITATE HIS COMEDY STYLE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BELIEVE IT OR NOT
2WGyTLYerpo_23	I DIDNT EXPECT THAT
BI97DNYfe5I_22	IT IS FUNNY ITS A FUNNY MOVIE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_13	HES REALLY INTO THERE IS NOT A MOVIE THAT I SEE HIM IN THAT I DONT END UP CRYING BECAUSE HE IS SO FANTASTIC AND HE JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART WHENEVER HE DOES YOU KNOW ROLE THAT USUALLY IS ROASTED BREAKER AT SOME POINT SO DEFINITELY GET IN THIS MOVIE
bOL9jKpeJRs_2	IT WAS FULL OF ACTION
73jzhE8R1TQ_17	AND LIKE I SAID IT WASNT THANK YOU
8qrpnFRGt2A_1	AND I DIDNT I WAS WATCHING THIS I PURPOSELY PUT IT ON BECAUSE I FIGURED IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE STUPID THAT I COULD FALL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND NOT MISS TOO MUCH
6Egk_28TtTM_5	AND MY FAVORITE PART WAS WHEN MILO HACKS TO SAVE
c7UH_rxdZv4_3	I WISH IT WERENT BECAUSE I
_dI--eQ6qVU_2	AND I LOVED IT
Bfr499ggo-0_13	NOT EVEN NECESSARY THE PLOT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_4	BUT I GOTTA SAY EIGHT MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE LOWERED BY THESE OTHER REVIEWS I READ BUT
VbQk4H8hgr0_30	AND JUST AS THEY ARE WITH ALL THE OTHER SIGNALS THAT ARE COMING OUT AND THIS
Nzq88NnDkEk_26	CRACKING ON THIS MOVIE DONT GO SEE IT GO SEE SOMETHING ELSE HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON AND THATS ALWAYS SAY ABOUT THAT SO
Nzq88NnDkEk_4	LITTLE HAS TO FIRST DO YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE WITH THE WITH THE REBOOT
VbQk4H8hgr0_5	I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THAT
ob23OKe5a9Q_8	EIGHT EIGHT YOUNGER KIDS TO REMOVING THE DEFINITE FAMILY MOVIE
HEsqda8_d0Q_15	KIND OF FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS THREE DAY THE VOICE IS
GWuJjcEuzt8_18	IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO SPEND GO AHEAD
Oz06ZWiO20M_6	AT SEVERAL POINTS IS A FAILURE BUT LIKE A REALLY AMBITIOUS WEIRD INTERESTING IDIOSYNCRATIC FAILURE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_8	FOUR MISSES OUT ON THE MAGIC THAT MADE THE FIRST FILM A REAL JOY TO VIEW
ZUXBRvtny7o_18	THE CHARACTER STUFF I AM NUMBER FOUR ARE LIKE
G-xst2euQUc_1	IT WAS A REALLY CUTE MOVIE I
iiK8YX8oH1E_7	MOSTLY ITS JUST KATE HUDSON BEING VERY ANNOYING
f9O3YtZ2VfI_12	ANOTHER THING IS WE DONT NEED IS ENTIRELY
1iG0909rllw_18	REMAINS EVEN WITH A BIGGER BETTER BUDGETS IT WAS STILL TOO LONG
2WGyTLYerpo_35	AND SHE DOESNT REALLY GOOD JOB ALSO
tmZoasNr4rU_12	I JUST COULDNT FIND IT FUNNY
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_20	I CAN APPRECIATE THAT
0h-zjBukYpk_6	STRANGE SINCE ONE OF MY BIGGEST GRIPES WITH THE X MEN SERIES WAS AND ALWAYS IS DIECAST STICK NOW SHE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_1	THE MAIN DRAW FOR ME FOR THIS MOVIE WAS JUST THE FACT THAT ITS SET IN THIS LIKE RIDICULOUS WORLD WITH ALL THESE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL COLORS IN RIDICULOUS ACTION SEQUENCES
c7UH_rxdZv4_32	YEAH SKIP IT
wMbj6ajWbic_18	YOU KNOW THE THIRD THING THEN THERE IS THIS IS A CHEESY MOVIE
IumbAb8q2dM_11	I HEARD THAT IN THE BOOK IT DESCRIBES THE PLAN OF LAURIE A LOT BETTER
2iD-tVS8NPw_15	IT LOOKS LIKE A CARTOON
Iu2PFX3z_1s_7	THERES ALL THESE COLORFUL CHARACTERS
OtBXNcAL_lE_24	JUST GET SO TIRED OF UNPREDICTABLE MOVIES LIKE
8OtFthrtaJM_8	THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS CONSTANTLY COMPARING IT TO INCEPTION
Vj1wYRQjB-o_8	I DID A GOOD JOB OF THE CAR
G-xst2euQUc_15	ANYWAY I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF IF YOURE LIKE ME AND YOU DONT NORMALLY GO TO SEE ANIMATED MOVIES AND
2WGyTLYerpo_62	VERY GOOD TIME
Ci-AH39fi3Y_32	THE MOVIE WAS GOOD
W8NXH0Djyww_21	ALL ITS JUST SO COOL THAT
9qR7uwkblbs_11	THATS PART OF THE   MOVIE WAS THIS ONE SCENE WHERE RYAN GOSLING JUST STANDING THERE IN A  SUIT EATING PIZZA IN SLOW  MOTION
ob23OKe5a9Q_14	THREE STARS FOR SMART AND SPACE MURPHY EVERYONE
pLTX3ipuDJI_11	ALTHOUGH WE DID DO WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BUT DIDNT MAKE SENSE
2WGyTLYerpo_63	AND I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU CHECK IT OUT IN THEATERS BECAUSE
W8NXH0Djyww_20	I AM SURE WHAT THEY WERE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_33	SO IF IVE LEFT LIKE NO CLOSURE AT ALL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE
9qR7uwkblbs_10	AND YOU SHOULD ALL GO OUT AND SEE IT AND YOU KNOW STUFF
BvYR0L6f2Ig_26	YOU KNOW SHES GOING TO THE STRESS AND YOU FEEL SORRY FOR YOU WANT TO HELP
pLTX3ipuDJI_10	WHATS THIS ALL WEEK OVERALL FOR ME THEN WERE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO HIM AND IT WAS GONE QUICKLY
c7UH_rxdZv4_33	DONT SEE IT
wMbj6ajWbic_19	SO YOU KNOW ITS NOT ACTUALLY GETTING LIKE A CAVITY OR QUALITY ACTING PERFORMANCES
IumbAb8q2dM_10	SO CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THE STORY LINE GOT TO THAT POINT I
2iD-tVS8NPw_14	YEAH GOING INTO IT OR AT LEAST WATCHING THE TRAILERS BEFORE AND I WAS REALLY A KIND OF HESITANT ABOUT SEEING THE GREEN LANTERN IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_6	YOU NEVER KNOW WHATS GONNA HAPPEN
8OtFthrtaJM_9	BUT I MUST SAY THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY BIG SHOES TO FILL SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IT HAS A CHANCE I
Vj1wYRQjB-o_9	TO TAKE A JOB WITH THE FIGHT SCENES
G-xst2euQUc_14	I HAD NO IDEA AND HALFWAY COULD REALLY SAYING IF
ZUXBRvtny7o_19	NOT LIKE THE CHARACTERS RIGHT

Nzq88NnDkEk_5	YOU KNOW ITS GOING TO BE GOOD

cW1FSBF59ik_1	HOW WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THEM FAILED MOST FAIL MOVIES OF THE X MEN FRANCHISE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_25	BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE BEST PART OF SOFT FIVE WAS THE STORY LINE LIKE IN GENERAL EVERYTHING
2WGyTLYerpo_4	IF YOURE EXPECTING SOME ARTSY SPURIOUS OSCAR CONTENDER THEN YOURE WRONG
Oz06ZWiO20M_15	IT REALLY HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH A MUSICAL OR OPERA OR EVEN A BALLET THAN A REGULAR NARRATIVE FILM BECAUSE LIKE A
c7UH_rxdZv4_25	AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE OKAY
Qr1Ca94K55A_7	WHATEVER SO NOW IM NOT SAYING THIS MOVIE IS THAT BECAUSE ITS ITS NOT

PZ-lDQFboO8_8	I YOU KNOW ALONG WITH THE SO ON I WOULD PROBABLY SAY GO SEE THIS MOVIE AND EARLY SHOWING DONT SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE NIGHT VIEWING
pLTX3ipuDJI_1	NOTHING HE WAS BROUGHT IN THOSE PREDATOR SERIES NO SURPRISES NO BIG TWIST NO FINISH
1DmNV9C1hbY_3	IT HAD A REALIST OBJECTS FEEL TO IT
jUzDDGyPkXU_6	IN FACT THIS MOVIE ISNT EVEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DISTRICT NINE NOR IS IT FOR BLACK HAWK DOWN WHICH PEOPLE ARE COMPARED TO
2WGyTLYerpo_59	I REALLY ENJOYED COWBOYS AND ALIENS IM
zhpQhgha_KU_30	BECAUSE THERE REALLY WASNT ALL THAT MUCH TO IT FOR ME
8d-gEyoeBzc_24	IT ACTUALLY FOUND WHEN HES SAYING COME UP ITS LIKE THE MOVIE DAMN AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM LEAVE PREDATORS TO PREDATORS COMPARED TO A PREDATOR
1iG0909rllw_7	TAKING ON HEARING THAT CHRIS WEITZ WAS GONNA START YOU MEAN BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT WAS FOR THE PULLMANS THE GOLDEN COMPASS
73jzhE8R1TQ_3	BECAUSE NUMBER FOUR WAS NOT MY ALL TIME FAVORITE 
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_18	SO YEAH GO SEE IT
etzxEpPuc6I_15	NO ONE IS HALF THE BATTLE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_31	DIFFERENT PEOPLE GOT WRITING CREDIT FOR THIS MOVIE AND THE RESULTS ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT
aiEXnCPZubE_16	AND THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND

6_0THN4chvY_7	FUNNY JOKES OF THE KIDS WILL GET
OQvJTdtJ2H4_9	PREVIEWS MUCH MORE THREE D THEN IT IN THE SEARCH AREA IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING
cXypl4FnoZo_21	WE WISH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PETER BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE THAT PETER
f9O3YtZ2VfI_3	IT IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD A GOOD CORE
9J25DZhivz8_7	THE STORY HAD ELEMENTS OF IT BUT THIS MOVIE PLAYED WITH THREE D AND A DIFFERENT WAY SO IT CAN MATCH YOU OUT OF THE SCREEN
9qR7uwkblbs_4	IN A WAY THAT MADE IT WAS REALLY  AWESOME
d6hH302o4v8_10	HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IN
zhpQhgha_KU_26	I THINK THEY ARE LIKE A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT
MLal-t_vJPM_5	ITS PROBABLY THE BEST THING THAT CURRENTLY IN THEATERS
d3_k5Xpfmik_11	THIS CREDIT SEQUENCE I THINK HES THE BEST CREDIT SEQUENCE AND SINCE WATCHMEN
cW1FSBF59ik_11	HE CERTAINLY DOESNT FIT THE BILL EITHER FOR ANY MARVEL MOVIE ZERO
1DmNV9C1hbY_12	SURE THE LITTLE CUTE FUNNY PARTS IN MIXED IN WITH THE
bvLlb-M3UXU_8	THE BAD GUY GUY GO TAKE A MINUTE THATS REALLY ALL YOU NEED
LSi-o-IrDMs_21	BUT THIS LOOKS AMAZING REALLY GOOD
7JsX8y1ysxY_17	SHE LOOKED LIKE A SUPERHERO
G6GlGvlkxAQ_10	OUR GREAT MOVIE OVERALL
BXuRRbG0Ugk_27	THEYRE ALL PLAYING KLAY SHADES STOCK WESTERN CHARACTERS BUT
vyB00TXsimI_16	THERES A SCENE IN A CAVE WHERE THEY FIGHT A GIANT MONSTER THAT REALLY REMINDS ME OF LIKE SOME SORT OF LORD OF THE RINGS MINES OF MORIA MOMENTS
_dI--eQ6qVU_16	SURE ITS FUN TO SEE SUPERHERO GO AROUND AND KICK THAT GUY BUT YOU KNOW PUNCH KICK WHATEVER PHANTOM
I5y0__X72p0_24	ITS NOT LIKE A REALLY GOOD TWIST
2WGyTLYerpo_18	ALIENS ARE REALLY COOL
k5Y_838nuGo_27	WAFFLES AND RUN YOUR OWN RECORD ENOUGH TO THINK THAT SOUNDS DIRTY BECAUSE IT TOTALLY DOES LAWFUL
lXPQBPVc5Cw_27	I TELL YOU I COULDNT GET OUT OF THAT MOVIE THEATER FAST ENOUGH

Sqr0AcuoNnk_9	I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FUNNY
jUzDDGyPkXU_24	I CAN I WOULD READ THAT THAT MIGHT I MEAN SCHWARZENEGGER NEVER SAID ANYTHING REALLY THAT BAD  IN HIS MOVIES
BioHAh1qJAQ_12	YOU HAVE NEW CHARACTERS TO ACTUALLY HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE OLD ONES
nbWiPyCm4g0_3	THIS MOVIE ISNT JUST BASS ITS DIABOLICAL
9J25DZhivz8_13	AND THERE IS ONE TIME WHERE I THOUGHT I ACTUALLY HEARD RUSSELL BRAND SELF
Af8D0E4ZXaw_11	I WAS WITH YOU BEFORE I GET TO THE NEGATIVES OF THE MOVIE LET ME LIST OFF A FEW OF THE POSITIVES
nzpVDcQ0ywM_2	THE PLOT HAS THE CONSISTENCY OF SWISS CHEESE
Clx4VXItLTE_25	EVERY TIME THERE WAS LIKE A JOKE EVERYONE JOIN
2iD-tVS8NPw_18	REALLY THE ROUTE THAT YOURE GOING TO GO
Jkswaaud0hk_16	I DO THINK ITS WERE SAYING
wMbj6ajWbic_15	I DID LIKE TRANSFORMS TO EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDNT LIKE THAT
2iD-tVS8NPw_7	I I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THIS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIRST MOVIES THIS YEAR THAT IVE SEEN THIS YEAR THAT YOU WANT TO SEE IN THREE D ESPECIALLY FOR JUST THE OPENING PORTION
aiEXnCPZubE_20	THANK YOU KNOW THEY THEY BRING NOTHING TO THE TABLE
7JsX8y1ysxY_37	IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS SORT OF OVERWHELMINGLY BAD
X3j2zQgwYgE_7	AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THAT RIGHT NOW SO
G-xst2euQUc_18	AND WE REALLY WANT TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT YESTERDAY WAS A
Vj1wYRQjB-o_5	I KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO
8OtFthrtaJM_5	BUT THERES A REASON FOR THAT THERES A REASON FOR WHY I WAS CONFUSED
8d-gEyoeBzc_12	ACTUALLY HE WAS WELL DEVELOPED
phBUpBr1hSo_11	I LOVE MY MOVIES TO BE LONG
d6hH302o4v8_30	AND WAS ALSO
tIrG4oNLFzE_3	I REALLY ENJOYED IT REMEMBER ME AND DID JOHN
Nzq88NnDkEk_9	TO ME SOMEONE NEEDS TO RELEASE THE CRACKING ON THIS MOVIE AND JUST TOTALLY DESTROYED BECAUSE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_31	STILL ITS THAT KIND OF MOVIE MAKING
cM3Yna7AavY_7	IT WAS INCREDIBLE SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT COLORS HOW ITS SMOOTH HAND DRAWN ANIMATION YOU KNOW
dq3Nf_lMPnE_5	IT HAPPENED IN TRACK ONE TWO AND THREE ARE WIPED AWAY
BioHAh1qJAQ_3	AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES PEOPLE FIND THAT COMPUTERS CAN YOU EVERY EVERY ANYTHING AT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_7	GIVEN ALL THE STRIKES THAT HAD GOING AGAINST IT BEFORE ONE TO PRODUCTION IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH WORSE
GWuJjcEuzt8_15	AND PROBABLY I GIVE IT ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE STARS YOU KNOW POPCORN MOVIE AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU
ob23OKe5a9Q_5	I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER PROBLEM I HAVE WITH IT BUT WARRANT IN THE JOKES REALLY CHEESY
HEsqda8_d0Q_18	AS AN ENGLISH PRESS AND I GET REALLY ANNOYED WHEN AMERICAN SHOWS AND FILMS HAVE AN ENGLISH CHARACTER
Njd1F0vZSm4_12	ANYWAY THIS IS
VbQk4H8hgr0_8	IM ONLY FUNNY
1iG0909rllw_15	THE BOOK IS NECESSARY THE MOST THRILLING BOOK AS A
2WGyTLYerpo_38	IT GIVES AN ENTERTAINING PERFORMANCE AS HE KIND OF LIKE THE LEADER OF THE TOWN
bOL9jKpeJRs_26	WEVE OVERCOME THAT
tStelxIAHjw_6	I LIKE SENDING EMAIL
ZUXBRvtny7o_15	ITS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE MOVIE
wMbj6ajWbic_1	I REALLY WANT TO SEE IT ACTUALLY BUT
f_pcplsH_V0_10	I THINK THIS WOULD GET BETWEEN TWO

tmZoasNr4rU_1	I WANT TO QUICKLY TALK ABOUT MACHETE
Clx4VXItLTE_13	SOMETIMES ITS JUST A BIT LIKE OLD GOLD YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT CRINGE
atnd_PF-Lbs_18	SECOND OF ALL MY GOD THAT WAS CRAZY THAT KIND OF SIT THERE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_27	THE ACTING RANGES FROM MEDIOCRE TO HAM FISTED FROM A LIVE ACTION ACTORS THE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_10	IT ALSO THE CUTE WINKS TO POP CULTURE
9J25DZhivz8_25	WHAT MADE THIS MOVIE REALLY FUN WITH SOME OF THE ADULT HUMOR JABS
Clx4VXItLTE_7	AS FREAKY AS HELL YEAH M BOTH
BvYR0L6f2Ig_6	AND BUT SOME OF THE PLUS PLUS THANK YOU MAY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_12	BASICALLY A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT I COULD TAKE A MOVIE ON ITS REALLY WOBBLY
TvyZBvOMOTc_11	ALL THOSE MOVIE BRINGS A CUTE LAUGH HERE THERE
BioHAh1qJAQ_24	BECAUSE I AS ALWAYS AND THIS IS LIKE WHAT WHY DO WE NEED THESE THINGS
jUzDDGyPkXU_12	THEY ALWAYS LIKE PULL OUT SOMETHING NEW AND
Iu2PFX3z_1s_12	ITS COLORFUL ITS
TvyZBvOMOTc_7	ITS A FUN CHECKS LIKE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_11	WHEN THERE IS
bOL9jKpeJRs_30	[UNK]
k5Y_838nuGo_11	I I DID ENJOY IT
I5y0__X72p0_12	ERIC BANA AND SAYS SHE TRAINED TO BE THIS MOST PARANOID ASSASSIN CHICK IN THE WORLD BECAUSE
tIrG4oNLFzE_13	THANK YOUR DAUGHTER IS OKAY MY MISSION THE FAMOUS FASHION BEGINNING WHEN SHOULD THAT FOUND THE COURSE AND HARMS CRUST AND JUST LOOK HOW INTO THE DISTANCE LIKE JUST WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION OCEAN BEACH WE SHOULD LOOK AT DATA SHE TOOK HER BROTHER WITH PLAIN EXPRESSION IM ALWAYS JUST LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW I I DONT UNDERSTAND WITH CHARACTERS DURING LIKE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_9	BUT PEOPLE COULD HANDLE THIS MOVIE THERE ARE SOME NEGATIVES TO SAY THE LEAST
_dI--eQ6qVU_20	JUST DIFFERENT
vyB00TXsimI_20	AND I ENJOYED MYSELF A LOT AT THE MOVIE
6Egk_28TtTM_8	IT DEPENDS WHAT AGE YOU ARE AND HOW YOU TO HAVE C RIGHT C
BXuRRbG0Ugk_11	THE FINAL PRODUCT ULTIMATELY DOESNT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE IN ORDER THAT FIRST TRAILER BUT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_26	THEY DIDNT BELIEVE HER STORY
7JsX8y1ysxY_21	WHO WAS JUST KICKED  HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME WAS THE GUY THAT PLAYED ON WILSHIRE
LSi-o-IrDMs_17	BUT THEY LOOKED AWESOME IT
c7UH_rxdZv4_29	YOU SEEM TO HAVE GENUINE AFFECTION FOR OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
BI97DNYfe5I_6	TO ME THATS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE
rnaNMUZpvvg_2	IT WAS A FUN EXPERIENCE GOING LIKE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_3	AND PUT THEM IN A JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIE WITH A RETOOLED BATMAN AND SUPERMAN
zhpQhgha_KU_10	I MEAN IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE SHOW WHEN YOU REALLY LIKED THE FIRST MOVIE AND YOU STILL WANT TO GO SEE THE SECOND ONE IM NOT GOING TO DISCOURAGE YOU FROM SEEING IT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_29	THATS NOT TO SAY THAT THE ENDING WASNT GOOD BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_13	MARLON WAYANS KIND OF PLAYS A WATERED DOWN VERSION OF HIMSELF FROM OTHER MOVIES
d6hH302o4v8_26	ACTUALLY THE RIVER DOMINOS
Oz06ZWiO20M_19	THEN COMPELLING IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS COMPELLING AND THEN I HAVE A STORY THATS LIKE FIVE MINUTES THIS HAPPENS IN TEN MINUTES THIS HAPPENS THAT LIKE MOVES FORWARD IT HAS MOMENTUM
cXypl4FnoZo_17	ITS JUST LIKE THERES THIS CHARACTER WAS KIND OF RANDOM
2WGyTLYerpo_8	THE VISUAL EFFECTS ARE PRETTY COOL
bvLlb-M3UXU_11	AND THATS ALL THATS ALL WE NEEDED TO DO AND IT DOES
HEsqda8_d0Q_22	I DOUBT THAT THEYRE GOING TO DO THIS FOR ALL OF THE SCREENINGS BECAUSE THE PRIME YEAH
zhpQhgha_KU_6	I MEAN IT HAD SOME GOOD MOMENTS
PZ-lDQFboO8_4	I EVEN THE KIDS IN THE AUDIENCE ITSELF JUST KIND OF CHUCKLED A LITTLE BIT GAVE A FEW LAST
Nzq88NnDkEk_11	IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WAS NO STORY DEVELOPMENT AND THATS
9T9Hf74oK10_2	PARTICULARLY THEN MOVIES I FEEL I SHOULD HAVE GOT NOMINATED BUT DIDNT AND NEVER LET ME GO IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE MOVIES
6_0THN4chvY_14	I I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT
IumbAb8q2dM_5	SO
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_17	NOT ALL INSTANCES BUT THE ONES THAT MATTER THE MOST YEAH
Qr1Ca94K55A_10	ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS DISAPPOINTED THOUGH WAS I FELT THAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE A LOT MORE WITH THREE D I THOUGHT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_25	MAYBE ITS JUST NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH
c5xsKMxpXnc_1	I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GONNA BE REALLY GOOD BECAUSE MATT DAMON WAS SET AND
7JsX8y1ysxY_8	WHAT WAS WEIRD WAS THE FACT THAT IN PART OF THE MOVIE HES WEARING LIKE A BLUE OVERALL FORM THING METAL PHONE THING SO LIKE WHEN I WORK THE WHOLE TIME YOU KNOW WHY YOU WHY YOU GOTTA GO COMMANDO HONEST
9c67fiY0wGQ_6	I ALSO BOUGHT SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE WERE FUNNY FOR EXAMPLE GARGAN WAS CASTRATION EXPRESSIONS
ZUXBRvtny7o_8	AND IF I THINK ABOUT THAT EAST OUT OF OLD SONGS WELL NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF THE SONGS IM NOT AWARE OF WELL CONNECTED WITH THE SCENES
cM3Yna7AavY_11	I LIKELY LOWERED STITCH
Ci-AH39fi3Y_6	AND I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN SOFT FOR NOT EXACT
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_14	AND THE DIALOGUE THREW ME OFF OF THE
etzxEpPuc6I_19	I THINK WELL GET SHOT IN THE EYE YOU KNOW AND THAT BE IT THE PEOPLE GETTING SHOT IN THE ARM AND THEN THE THE HEADS OF SPALDING AND SOME DO GET HIS TORSO CUT OPEN AND AND AND SOME DO HAVE A CAR IS HEADING UP ALONE ARE OFTEN FORGET PEOPLE FLYING AND JUMP IN
POKffnXeBds_2	DONT GET ME WRONG KATE HUDSON IS IS PRETTY FINE LOOKING BUT I JUST THINK ITS KIND OF STUPID I WANT TO SAY SHE HAS A FAT 
OQvJTdtJ2H4_14	THATS EXACTLY HOW I THOUGHT A GIANT SCORPIONS LOOK WITH THE PEACE OF THRIFT STORE THAT HAS BLUE FIRE ON IT
Njd1F0vZSm4_6	THEY DO HAVE VERY NICE PERSONALITIES AND
OtBXNcAL_lE_13	I DONT CARE FOR BASICALLY ANY OF IT BECAUSE
iiK8YX8oH1E_13	BUT I DONT THINK SHES LEADING MATERIAL AND
VbQk4H8hgr0_50	YOU SHOULD REALLY BE ONE
2iD-tVS8NPw_22	THIS IS A PLAYGROUND AND A MASSIVE PLAYGROUND AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN I THINK THATS WHAT ALSO MADE THE FILM EXCITING BECAUSE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_3	IT WAS A COOL MOVIE THE
W8NXH0Djyww_1	I WAS JUST A PAST SIX SURPRISE
k5Y_838nuGo_1	WHICH I WAS NOT EXCITED SEE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_10	THE SECOND ONE HUNDRED WOODEN ACTING IN SOME PLACES IM SORRY
8d-gEyoeBzc_28	THEY THEY IMMEDIATELY IF A NONCE FISHBURNES CHARACTER IT DOES SLOW DOWN A GREAT DEAL
9qR7uwkblbs_26	HES NOT LIKE A SERIOUS LIKE A MOVIE OR ANYTHING
VCslbP0mgZI_13	I COULD KIND OF SEE THAT IN A SORT OF CHRIS ROCK DAVE CHAPELLE WAY
W8NXH0Djyww_16	ALL THE SUN SETS ALL THE LANDSCAPES OF THE FILM THEY JUST LOOK SO REALISTIC IN EVERY ALMOST EVERY SCENE
2WGyTLYerpo_55	AND SOMETIMES IT KIND OF YEARS INTO CLICHE ACTION MOVIE TERRITORY
yDtzw_Y-7RU_10	SOMETIMES I MISSED WHAT WAS BEING SET
0h-zjBukYpk_20	BUT THE TWO BIG CHARACTER APPEARANCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE EASILY DEADPOOL AND GAMBIT
vvZ4IcEtiZc_7	AND I THINK THAT LIVED DOWN TIME HAS BECOME KIND OF UNDERRATED
c7UH_rxdZv4_13	HES JUST JACKASS
bvLlb-M3UXU_4	AND YET THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLY ENJOYABLE FOR ACTION FANS ALL
G6GlGvlkxAQ_3	I THINK THAT WILL DO VERY WELL
POKffnXeBds_13	AND I JUST REALLY WASNT GOOD
VbQk4H8hgr0_46	IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER I
8OtFthrtaJM_13	WHICH KIND OF JUST RUINS THE SUSPENSE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE IF THEYVE GOT SOME CONVENIENT GUY IN A FEDORA JUST TELL YOU YES WE HA THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF RUINS THE SUSPENSE AND
Oz06ZWiO20M_23	THE CHARACTERS ARE JUST PLACE HOLDERS
OQvJTdtJ2H4_5	FIRST AND ITS
WKA5OygbEKI_11	SOMETHING I WOULD RECOMMEND UNLESS
2WGyTLYerpo_43	AND ALSO OLIVIA WILDE SHES PRETTY GOOD SHES BEAUTIFUL
MLal-t_vJPM_9	AND ITS REALLY WELL WRITTEN
Ci-AH39fi3Y_13	AND THE RELEVANT PLOT WAS WITH FIVE RANDOM STRANGERS KIND OF LIKE
9qR7uwkblbs_30	IM GONNA SPOIL SKINS RIGHT NOW I TOTALLY KNEW MADDIE NICK WERE GOING TO BE RELATED I  KNEW IT LIKE I KNEW IT
VCslbP0mgZI_1	SO
9qR7uwkblbs_8	I THINK THE BEST PART OF MAYBE IM NOT
5W7Z1C_fDaE_3	ITS A BOLD ITS
HEsqda8_d0Q_34	WHEREAS THE DISASTROUS SO ENJOY
Clx4VXItLTE_29	IT DOES GET A BIT LIKE NOT AS REAL AS WHAT IS BEEN GOING ON
VbQk4H8hgr0_11	REALLY THAT FUNNY
ZAIRrfG22O0_6	IF YOU LIKE WE CAN MOVE THAT BEN STILLER DID A NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM THEN YOU PROBABLY WOULD LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
I5y0__X72p0_28	IT WAS THEY DID OUT OF THE MOVIE THOUGH IT AND
cXypl4FnoZo_3	I LIKED IT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_5	I JUST DONT THINK IT WAS VERY GOOD
BI97DNYfe5I_15	HE DID A GREAT JOB
Ci-AH39fi3Y_44	YOU KNOW I GUESS IT BOUNCES OUT
2WGyTLYerpo_14	SEEMS LIKE CRAZY
nbWiPyCm4g0_4	FIRST LET ME JUST SAY I SAW QUITE A FEW GUYS AT THE CINEMA WHO CLEARLY BEEN JACKED UP ON IT GIRL FRIENDS AND SO THOSE GUYS I SAY WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SO YOUR BALLS BACK ON FOR YOU
BioHAh1qJAQ_15	THEY DONT WASTE OUR TIME ON EXPOSITION BECAUSE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_5	I FEEL LIKE IT ALMOST SHOULD HAVE HAD A G RATING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_16	PERFECT FOR THAT ROLE
Clx4VXItLTE_22	SOULFULLY
9J25DZhivz8_14	BUT OTHERWISE I THOUGHT HE WAS EXCELLENT AS FOR THREE D I
I5y0__X72p0_23	IT DOESNT HAVE A DEEP SIMPLOT THERES
cXypl4FnoZo_8	BUT I I LIKE SEEING FEMALE DIRECTORS BECAUSE THERE ARENT THAT MANY COMPARED TO YOU KNOW GUY DIRECTORS
_dI--eQ6qVU_11	I FEEL LIKE IF THEY WOULDNT HAVE INSERTED THE HUMOR INTO THIS MOVIE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST TOO SERIOUS AND KIND OF BORING IN A SENSE
vyB00TXsimI_11	WHICH BASICALLY MEANS HES WARM TONGUE AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT WAY
jUzDDGyPkXU_23	BUT HE TOTALLY SELLS IT
ZUXBRvtny7o_32	I DONT WANT TO GO WITH FRIENDS I DONT WITH FAMILY TO WATCHING IT RAINY DAY AND IF YOU CAN WATCH IT AT A HOUSE RICE MEAT NIGHT STROKE SCREENING
k5Y_838nuGo_20	THIRTY FOUR KIDS

f9O3YtZ2VfI_4	BUT EIGHT JUST TO MANY PROBLEMS WITH IT
cXypl4FnoZo_26	WHAT IS NICER THAN PETER
d6hH302o4v8_17	MAKE NO SENSE EIGHT
nbWiPyCm4g0_10	MIRANDA WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE BEST CONFERENCES
aiEXnCPZubE_7	AND I DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE HATING ON THE FILM BECAUSE I REALLY DO LOVE IT
2WGyTLYerpo_48	SOME FLAWS HERE
MLal-t_vJPM_2	YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON

9qR7uwkblbs_3	SO THERES NOT GONNA BE ANY LIKE BAD 
etzxEpPuc6I_12	SO THIS IS A LIFE
POKffnXeBds_9	AND HALF THE WAY IS REALLY OVERRATED IN MY OPINION
73jzhE8R1TQ_4	THE SECOND THOUGHT
OtBXNcAL_lE_18	[UNK]
iiK8YX8oH1E_18	SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY REALISTIC CHARACTER HERE
2iD-tVS8NPw_29	LOOKING FORWARD TO IT I GOTTA SAY ITS
wMbj6ajWbic_24	ONE WAY THAT A LOT OF FUN
aiEXnCPZubE_11	THE HITS INCLUDE OSCAR ISAAC AS THE MAIN VILLAIN LIKE I SAID BLUE JENA MALONE IS THE SOFT SPOKEN ROCKET AND THE SHOW STEALING AT THE CORNER JUST REPEAT A TROUBLED A RELUCTANT YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PACK
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_8	COUPLE FUNNY PARTS BUT
jUzDDGyPkXU_1	THE ACTION IS  AWESOME
8d-gEyoeBzc_23	I THINK RODRIGUEZ WHEN HE WROTE THE RIGHT RIGHT THE MOVIE WAS CRYING FOR MOM BRENDA APOCALYPSE NOW TYPE OF CHARACTER BY
phBUpBr1hSo_20	I DONT THINK IT WAS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE OBVIOUSLY I MEAN I THINK THE FIRST MOVIE WAS JUST FANTASTIC
HEsqda8_d0Q_29	ITS NOT MY FAVORITE PHONE OF A
pLTX3ipuDJI_6	OF THE ACTING NOTHING SOUNDS OUT A SPECTACULAR WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED OF A MOVIE LIKE THIS
1DmNV9C1hbY_4	IT REMINDED ME OF GETTING UP ON A SATURDAY MORNING AND EATING FRUIT LOOPS AND WATCHING CARTOONS
9T9Hf74oK10_9	IN A WAY A LOT OF THE THEMES AND NEVER LET ME GO WHICH WERE VERY PROFOUND AND DEEP
I5y0__X72p0_35	BUT IT WAS IT WAS INTERESTING
5W7Z1C_fDaE_21	THERE I SAY FUN TO WATCH IN A REALLY MESSED UP KIND OF WAY AND
8qrpnFRGt2A_23	AND THERES A LOT OF IT
I5y0__X72p0_4	SO I SAW SOME OTHER REVIEWS AND I WAS LIKE OKAY I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE
7JsX8y1ysxY_3	SO REALLY SUCKY ACTING
d6hH302o4v8_7	WHAT IS ON SCREEN I WANT TO PUNCH IN THE FACE
1iG0909rllw_24	I MEAN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LAUGHING
bOL9jKpeJRs_17	IT WAS SO CUTE
f_pcplsH_V0_4	BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE HAVING HELL BE ABLE TO BE EVERYWHERE IF THERES TWO OF THEM
ZUXBRvtny7o_24	THAT PICTURE RIGHT THE WORKS REALLY GREAT
ZUXBRvtny7o_3	BUT I WENT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT THIS WILL BE
c7UH_rxdZv4_22	I AM AND THE CHARACTERS DIDNT CARE WHETHER THEY LIVED OR DIED
8OtFthrtaJM_22	I HAVE TO SAY MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS THE CHARACTER THOMPSON

2WGyTLYerpo_52	I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING THAT
W8NXH0Djyww_11	I LIKE THE DOM KIND OF COWBOYS THAT DONT KNOW WHAT THEYRE DOING ALWAYS ASKING DUMB QUESTIONS STATE SAYING STUPID 
iiK8YX8oH1E_14	LIKE I SAID KATE HUDSON COULDNT BE MORE ANNOYING HERE
OtBXNcAL_lE_14	[UNK]
73jzhE8R1TQ_8	IT DID A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THE BACKSTORY IN THE FALL
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_13	AND THEN IN THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY SHORT AS
POKffnXeBds_5	I MEAN THE MOVIE REALLY WASNT FUNNY AT ALL
Ci-AH39fi3Y_1	IM STILL EXCITED ABOUT IT
Njd1F0vZSm4_1	IM GOING TO GIVE THIS A GRADE B MINUS
OQvJTdtJ2H4_13	THE SEIZURE WAS GREAT AND
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_4	ACTING WAS ALRIGHT
wMbj6ajWbic_28	SO I THINK I THINK IT WAS COOL YOUR C RATE PARKING ACTION GREAT ACTION STARS
IumbAb8q2dM_21	HES BEEN A FAVORITE
2iD-tVS8NPw_25	WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR A GREEN LANTERN MOVIE TOO THAT WOULD BE EVEN LIKE WORTHWHILE NOW BECAUSE
I5y0__X72p0_8	I DIDNT THINK WAS GREATER AT BREAKER JUST FANTASTIC
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_10	REALLY FIRST AND FOREMOST IT JUST LACKS THE CHARM OF THESE PAST ROBIN HOOD MOVIES THAT WE KNOW
I5y0__X72p0_39	WHICH IS COOL
IumbAb8q2dM_2	ITS A WEIRD THING
6_0THN4chvY_13	ITS A GREAT ONE
9c67fiY0wGQ_1	AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WOULD APPEAL MORE TO YOUNGER AUDIENCES
cM3Yna7AavY_16	WHY DID I WATCH THAT MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_28	AND THIS MOVIE I WAS NOT LOOKING FOR TO SEE THIS MOVIE
f_pcplsH_V0_8	I THINK ITS HIGHLY UNDER RATED
1iG0909rllw_28	AND I THINK THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING BIT OF THE ENTIRE FILM
f9O3YtZ2VfI_22	LIKE I SAID BEFORE ITS A VERY INTERESTING IDEAS
c5xsKMxpXnc_6	THEY LEFT A LOT OF PLOT HOLES
HEsqda8_d0Q_25	I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHER PEOPLE ITS TRUE
bvLlb-M3UXU_16	KIND OF MADE ME FEEL DEPRESSED
Nzq88NnDkEk_16	BUT I JUST IS OLD REALLY DO NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE
9T9Hf74oK10_5	IT WAS A PRETTY SLOW MOVIE FOR THE MOST PART
1DmNV9C1hbY_8	THEY WERE JUST FLAT
PZ-lDQFboO8_3	IT DIDNT HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF HUMOR GOING ON WITH THAT AT LEAST NONE THAT REALLY MADE YOU WANT TO LAUGH OUT LOUD
zhpQhgha_KU_1	IM GONNA START OFF BY SAYING THAT I REALLY WASNT VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE MOVIE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_14	HE DOES SOME STEREO TYPICAL THINGS LIKE TALKING ABOUT BUSTING A CAP WHILE FLYING AN AIRPLANE
zhpQhgha_KU_17	EVERYTHING TO THINK THAT I REALLY LIKE THE MARANDA CHARACTERS ACTUALLY
d6hH302o4v8_21	BUT WHEN I SAW IT WAS JUST BOARD
cXypl4FnoZo_10	SO I THOUGHT SHE DID GREAT WITH THIS MOVIE
BI97DNYfe5I_1	AND IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
rnaNMUZpvvg_5	IT WASNT EVEN HOLDING MY ATTENTION I
7JsX8y1ysxY_26	THE OTHER GUY DID A REALLY GOOD JOB WAS JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN
G6GlGvlkxAQ_21	YOU HAVE TO STOP SECTOR THE QUICKLY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_16	ACTION SEQUENCES ARE CERTAINLY A LOT BETTER THAN THE INCOHERENT IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW SLOP THAT WE SEE IN A TYPICAL MICHAEL BAY MOVIE
LSi-o-IrDMs_10	THE CHARACTER ELEMENT IS NIL
Af8D0E4ZXaw_4	SO NOT ONLY DOES THIS MOVIE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BURDEN OF TELLING ITS OWN SELF CONTAINED STORY AND SETTING UP ITS OWN INEVITABLE SEQUELS
etzxEpPuc6I_7	BUT THINK ABOUT GI JOE COMPARED TO TRANSFORMERS IS TRANSFORMERS TO DIDNT KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO DO LIKE
cW1FSBF59ik_20	IN THIS HOME I LOVE YOU
lXPQBPVc5Cw_16	HI I WILL I WILL ACTUALLY SAY THIS RIGHT NOW IT WAS A GOOD WASTE OF LIKE TWELVE DOLLARS
BI97DNYfe5I_28	BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD GET A
Iu2PFX3z_1s_15	I THINK WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THIS WAS THAT HE REALLY TRIED VERY HARD TO MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL
OtBXNcAL_lE_7	I REALLY DONT CARE TO SEE THOSE
2WGyTLYerpo_29	KIND OF CHANNELS THE MAN WITH NO NAME CLINT EASTWOOD
k5Y_838nuGo_16	THE FIRST TWO OR KID MOVIES
jUzDDGyPkXU_15	DO NOT THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A GOOD REASON WHILE THEYRE WHY THEYRE ATTACKING AND
Sqr0AcuoNnk_19	THIS WEIRD
bOL9jKpeJRs_8	TEENY TINY BIT VIOLENT AND NOT ENOUGH SO YOU CANT BRING YOUR FIVE YEAR OLD
_dI--eQ6qVU_27	WHY NOT IF I WAS WEARING THREE D GLASSES AND WAS SEEING THIS IN THREE D I WOULD ENJOY IT A LOT MORE
c7UH_rxdZv4_9	AND UNLIKE OTHER FILMS WERE THERE KIND OF A NARCISSISTIC FRAT BOY BUT THEY BRING SOMETHING TO THE TABLE YOU KNOW THERE
d3_k5Xpfmik_7	THE WELL WE ALSO MAINTAINS ITS KIND AT DETACHED AND THE SATIRE THE GENRE
_dI--eQ6qVU_8	HE FUNNY UP THIS MOVIE BIG TIME TOTALLY
tIrG4oNLFzE_14	OKAY SIR AND WHAT YOU THINK AND HOW SHE FELL I HAD NOTHING I DID THAT IT WAS THE SAME EXPRESSION SHOCK SADNESS WILL WORK WITH YOU AND SHE SAT IT IT REALLY BUGS ME
I5y0__X72p0_15	GOOD
Bfr499ggo-0_19	BUT BACK MUCH
9J25DZhivz8_22	THERE IS A LOT OF CHEAP CHILD HUMOR WHICH
Clx4VXItLTE_14	AND FIRST REALLY GOOD LIKE
tmZoasNr4rU_6	THE ACTION AND HUMOR WERE MOSTLY FLAT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_20	AND I THOUGHT IT WORKED WORKED PRETTY WELL
QN9ZIUWUXsY_15	SO MANY MOMENTS IN THIS MOVIE THAT JUST FRAMED AND LIT SO PERFECTLY THAT SO THAT YOU JUST CALL IT KINDA WHO THATS REALLY REALLY COOL
HEsqda8_d0Q_9	THE DELIGHTFUL CHILD
BioHAh1qJAQ_23	AND THE WHOLE MOVIE BECOMES ABOUT THESE CRAZY I
BvYR0L6f2Ig_1	AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS WORK ON THE FIRST ONE
Jkswaaud0hk_7	SOME SCENES WHERE I THINK SOME OF THE WERE GONNA FEEL MORE THE EMOTION OF IT
wMbj6ajWbic_6	IN THE GOOD WAY I THINK THIS THERES TWO TYPES OF CHEESY AND THIS IS THE GOOD KIND OF CHEESY YES IT
ZUXBRvtny7o_12	RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE IT STARTS WITH REALLY GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES
bOL9jKpeJRs_21	AND THEN WHEN I WENT TO BLOCKBUSTER I PICKED IT UP AND I BROUGHT IT BACK HOME HE GOT REALLY DISAPPOINTED
1iG0909rllw_12	VERY VERY LOYAL TO THE BOOKING
tStelxIAHjw_1	RUNNING ONE ITS NOW WHAT WAS THE LAST MOVIE WE SAW IN THEATERS AND TO GIVE A REVIEW FOR IT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_18	THIS LOOKS LIKE IT JUST HAS A POLYURETHANE COATING ON IT
tmZoasNr4rU_18	[UNK]
8qrpnFRGt2A_15	AND THE LAST BIG THING WAS JUST THE IT IS I KNOW ITS ABOUT GI JOE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ITS GOING TO BE THAT THE ARMY BUT IT JUST FELT LIKE A LIKE MILITARY PROPAGANDA KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW
Bfr499ggo-0_6	I DIDNT LIKE THE FASHION
5W7Z1C_fDaE_17	IT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE FILMS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY FOR YOU TO FIND IT
rnaNMUZpvvg_10	EVEN HE WAS A DOUCHE BAG ALL OF THEM
fvVhgmXxadc_10	THE FIRST TIME SHE GOES IN IT LOOKS LIKE A JAPANESE TEMPLE
ob23OKe5a9Q_2	THREE STARS
GWuJjcEuzt8_12	THIS ARTICLE IT IS BY THE WAY BUT
BioHAh1qJAQ_4	EVERYTHING AND NOW TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY DOES ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING BECAUSE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_2	FOR A LAST MINUTE TITLE THAT THEY THROW AT THE THEATERS
9c67fiY0wGQ_12	THIS MARKS ARE SO ADORABLE AND EAGLE ONE THRILLING ADVENTURES
tIrG4oNLFzE_4	I REALLY DID ENJOY WITH THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE BUT
d6hH302o4v8_37	BORING
GWuJjcEuzt8_7	BECAUSE WHEN YOU SEE HER FACE MOSTLY FEELS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU IF YOU WORK FOR HOW YOU
Ci-AH39fi3Y_38	AND IT FITS VERY WELL TO THE SAW SERIES IN MY OPINION SO
phBUpBr1hSo_16	YOURE JUST KINDA LIKE OKAY LETS GET TO IT WE KNOW WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN LETS GO AHEAD AND DO IT
8d-gEyoeBzc_15	RIGHT THE GIRL WHO WAS THE ISRAELI SNIPER
phBUpBr1hSo_7	AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE I DONT REALLY THINK THATS NECESSARILY TRUE I THINK THE SECOND MOVIE IN THE THIRD MOVIE ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR I THINK THEY TRIED TO ADD A LOT OF HEART
7JsX8y1ysxY_30	HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB ACTING
aiEXnCPZubE_27	THEY ARE UNIQUE INCREDIBLE
wMbj6ajWbic_12	ITS QUITE HONESTLY I WISH ID SEEN THIS OVER THE SUMMER
Jkswaaud0hk_11	BUT IT WAS IN GOOD TASTE
8OtFthrtaJM_2	JUST ITS VERY ITS VERY CHAOTIC AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE I
Vj1wYRQjB-o_2	THEY ALSO CERVICAL GUNS THAT ITS LIKE A DESERT EAGLE BUT HAS TWO BARRELS TO IT
2iD-tVS8NPw_1	BEFORE I WANTED TO SEE THE GREEN AFTER IVE BEEN HEARING ALL THESE LIKE CRITICS BASICALLY JUST TRASH IN THIS MOVIE LEFT AND RIGHT AND I WAS
7JsX8y1ysxY_31	I WAS VERY IMPRESSED
X3j2zQgwYgE_1	NOT GREAT
aiEXnCPZubE_26	FIRST OF VISUAL EFFECTS HERE ARE STELLAR
Jkswaaud0hk_10	I WAS SURPRISED THE AMOUNT OF SKIN THEY SHOWED
wMbj6ajWbic_13	I SEE OVER THE SUMMER I PROBABLY WOULD RATED THE BEST ACTION MOVIE I SAW THIS SUMMER THIS
8OtFthrtaJM_3	I LITERALLY SAID OUT LOUD WHAT K THESE THESE MOVIE OF THE DAY AND SEEING WHAT THE STATUS
Vj1wYRQjB-o_3	ITS PRETTY PRETTY SCARY LOOKING

Ci-AH39fi3Y_39	CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WRITERS FOR THAT
GWuJjcEuzt8_6	AND HER FACE DOESNT MOVE AT ALL
8d-gEyoeBzc_14	SOMEONE YOU CARED ABOUT
phBUpBr1hSo_17	THE ACTION WAS GREAT YOU KNOW NOT TOO MUCH NOT TOO LITTLE JUST JUST ENOUGH ACTION
phBUpBr1hSo_6	AND HE SAID THAT THIS NEW ONE HAS A LOT OF HEART THE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE
fvVhgmXxadc_11	THEN LATER TIME SHE GOES LIKE A WORLD WAR TWO BATTLEFIELD CASTLE WAS KIND OF PULLED OVER THE RINGS
ob23OKe5a9Q_3	ITS VERY PREDICTABLE VERY PREDICTABLE
BioHAh1qJAQ_5	THE KIND OF CONTROLS OUR LIVES SO IT WAS THE PERFECT TIME FOR TRANS PEOPLE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_1	COWBOYS AND ALIENS METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE NFL TEAMS THAT HAS THE TALENT TO BE A SUPER BOWL CHAMPION BUT INSTEAD ENDS UP BEING A WILD CARD TEAMS IT GETS DISMISSED IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE PLAYOFFS
GWuJjcEuzt8_13	THE SILENCE IN THE MOVIE WONDERFUL
cM3Yna7AavY_1	I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE MOVIE THEATERS TO GO SEE A MOVIE IVE BEEN WAITING PROBABLY ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF TO TWO YEARS FOR
dq3Nf_lMPnE_3	DREAMWORKS IS CONFUSING ME
Jkswaaud0hk_6	I THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE GOING TO ENJOY THIS MORE THAN THE GUYS ARE CERTAINLY THERE
ZUXBRvtny7o_13	AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS
wMbj6ajWbic_7	THE ACTING IS A LITTLE ROUGH IN SOME PARTS OF THE
bOL9jKpeJRs_20	I GOT REALLY EXCITED WHEN I TOLD YOU WERE GOING TO SEE THE EXTENT
1iG0909rllw_13	I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT LUCY
f9O3YtZ2VfI_19	MAKES IT LOOK TOO TOO GOOD
tmZoasNr4rU_19	STILL THE THE CHURCH SHOOT OUT HOWEVER BRIEF THAT WAS IT WAS ALL RIGHT
Bfr499ggo-0_7	YOU CAN BET THAT IT WENT FROM WAY OVER THE TOP
8qrpnFRGt2A_14	ABOUT TWO HOURS WAS WAY TOO LONG FOR THIS MOVIE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_16	IT IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING
rnaNMUZpvvg_11	EVERY SINGLE COWBOY WHICH IS A COMPLETE DOUCHE BAG
9J25DZhivz8_23	EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO IT
Clx4VXItLTE_1	IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT LIKE GET INSTEAD JOB OR ANYTHING
Clx4VXItLTE_15	MY FRIENDS
tmZoasNr4rU_7	I I CANT EXPLAIN WHY THE HUMOR WHAT WAS MOSTLY FLAT BECAUSE A FEW MORE OF SEVERAL JOKES ACTUALLY FELL THE THE THING THAT YOU FELT FELT FUNNY
Af8D0E4ZXaw_21	AND IN FACT IN SPITE OF ALL THE NEGATIVES ON LETS MENTION I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS WORKING FOR A WHILE FOR ABOUT THE FIRST THIRD BUT AT THE END OF ACT ONE TWO SIGNIFICANT THINGS HAPPENED HECTOR HAMMOND ARRIVES
QN9ZIUWUXsY_14	I MEAN THIS MOVIE HAS THE MOST GORGEOUS VISUALS OUT OF ANY MOVIE SINCE PROBABLY AVATAR MEET IF NOT PRETTY HERE
BioHAh1qJAQ_22	THE WRITERS JUST PULL THIS OUT OF THEIR 
HEsqda8_d0Q_8	HES BEEN SUCH A GRUMPY CHARACTER IN THAT HES REALLY SCARED AND IN THE END HE SO CHANGED AND ITS REALLY FUNNY
BI97DNYfe5I_29	GETS PRETTY SERIOUS AND
Iu2PFX3z_1s_14	ITS REALLY NONSTOP FROM BEGINNING TO END
OtBXNcAL_lE_6	JUST DIFFERENT JUST DIFFERENT PEOPLE PLAYING THE ROLES
TvyZBvOMOTc_1	IN A BETTER NAME TO THE MOVIE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_17	IM NOT EVEN KIDDING I WENT WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS AND MOVIES WILL BE TEN TIMES BETTER WHEN YOURE WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS
2WGyTLYerpo_28	DANIEL CRAIG DOES A VERY GOOD JOB HERE HE
k5Y_838nuGo_17	ADULT HUMOR AND
Sqr0AcuoNnk_18	AND SHE TALKS LATER TO
jUzDDGyPkXU_14	THEY GIVE YOU A GOOD AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE MY
bOL9jKpeJRs_9	REALLY FELT FOR THE DAD IN THE EXPENDABLES
_dI--eQ6qVU_26	I FEEL LIKE EVEN THOUGH THE FIGHTING SEQUENCES WERE A LITTLE BIT LONG IN SOME PLACES
d3_k5Xpfmik_6	IT CONTAINS M REALLY REALLY WELL DORN AND FAITHFUL MANAGES TO BE AT SOME B HOROSCOPE GENRE THE
c7UH_rxdZv4_8	HE EARNED AT ALL THE CHARM OF A NARCISSISTIC RACKED BOY THE WHOLE FILM
_dI--eQ6qVU_9	SO THAT DOESNT SURPRISE ME
I5y0__X72p0_14	ITS IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE A SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL TYPE MOVIE ITS
tIrG4oNLFzE_15	I REALLY THINK IN THE LEAD LEAD TOMORROW YOU REALLY SHOULD PREPARE FOR THAT ROLE
Bfr499ggo-0_18	IF YOURE ON THE RIGHT
rnaNMUZpvvg_4	BUT ITS JUST SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY FOR THEM LIKE WHEN I SEE A MOVIE THATS OBVIOUSLY HAD A VERY BIG BUDGET AND ITS LIKE NOT EVEN GOOD IS THIS THE ANGRY BECAUSE IM JUST LIKE WHY ARE YOU WASTING SO MUCH MONEY
aiEXnCPZubE_30	THE ACTION IN THE MOVIE IS SO WELL USE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_20	WHY ARE THEY HERE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_17	BUT HIS ACTION ISNT PARTICULARLY MEMORABLE
7JsX8y1ysxY_27	HE IS VERY GOOD JOB
LSi-o-IrDMs_11	BUT NONE OF THOSE THINGS MATTER ITS A FUN MOVIE ANYWAY
Af8D0E4ZXaw_5	IT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF POTENTIALLY SETTING UP ALL THAT OTHER STUFF AND
etzxEpPuc6I_6	THEY HAVE A LOT OF ADULT SITUATIONS AND IT
cW1FSBF59ik_21	AND YOU PROBABLY DID THE BEST FOR TRANSIT WHICH IS EVER
zhpQhgha_KU_16	I THINK THAT CHARLOTTE AND MIRANDA HAS SOME REALLY NICE MOMENTS IN THE MOVIE I
nzpVDcQ0ywM_15	HES PRETTY AVERAGE TO
d6hH302o4v8_20	THE TRAILER LOOKED LIKE IT COULD BE A LITTLE GOOD
cXypl4FnoZo_11	AND YEAH I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GO SEE IF YOU WERE LIKE THINKING ABOUT SEEING IT BUT YOU WERENT SURE IF IT WOULD BE WORTH SEEING
HEsqda8_d0Q_24	IM REALLY REALLY REALLY GLAD I SAW IT AND
bvLlb-M3UXU_17	BUT WHATEVER AND HES SHOWN THAT YEAH MAYBE HES NOT WHAT HE WAS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BUT HE STILL HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE BILLED AS AN ACTION STAR
Nzq88NnDkEk_17	AT THE SCREEN I WAS THAT I I KIND OF FIND FOUND MYSELF YOU KNOW WANTING TO LAY MY HEAD BACK AND TAKE A NAP IN
9T9Hf74oK10_4	THERES A CERTAIN DEADPAN NATURE TO IT
1DmNV9C1hbY_9	YOUR KIDS ARE GONNA LOVE IT
PZ-lDQFboO8_2	BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS JUST A LITTLE DRY
I5y0__X72p0_9	IT WAS GOOD
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_11	ENTIDADES SWITCH YOU KNOW WHOLE AREA SPOOF OF THE STORY
I5y0__X72p0_38	THE MUSIC KIND OF DROVE ALL OF THE ACTION
IumbAb8q2dM_3	FROM THE READING REVIEW
6_0THN4chvY_12	SO IF YOU HAVENT SEEN ANY OF THE CREW AND DO YOU LIKE FAMILY FILMS GO SEE IT
ZUXBRvtny7o_29	BUT IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD
f_pcplsH_V0_9	I HATE SCREEN THREE RIGHT
1iG0909rllw_29	THE REST OF THE FILM WAS JUST WATCHING KRISTEN JUST BACKGROUND
f9O3YtZ2VfI_23	I DID A LOT OF GOOD THINGS WITH IT
c5xsKMxpXnc_7	THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE FOR THESE REASONS
OtBXNcAL_lE_15	THE SAME YOU KNOW RISE AND FALL
iiK8YX8oH1E_15	IF THERES ANY SILVER LINING IN THIS MOVIE ITS JOHN KRASINSKI WHO
73jzhE8R1TQ_9	AND JOB OF EXPLAINING THING WITH LAUREN AND LOOKING DORIANS NUMBER
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_12	THE WHOLE MOVIE DOES YOU KNOW THINKING THIS ISNT AS BAD AS IVE HEARD AND IT WASNT
POKffnXeBds_4	FIRST OF ALL THE MOVIE WAS BORING
OQvJTdtJ2H4_12	SO IT IS NOT A BY
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_5	I THOUGHT THEY CASTED KENNEWELL
wMbj6ajWbic_29	HE DOES A GREAT JOB OF SNAKE EYES ITS ALWAYS COOL TO SEE THAT
IumbAb8q2dM_20	SO EASY ON THE EYE
2iD-tVS8NPw_24	BUT THEN YOURE KIND OF LIKE WALK OUT OF THE MOVIE YOU KNOW LIKE WELL I I GET WHAT HAPPENED I UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED BUT
k5Y_838nuGo_7	THIS PIECE OF CRAP
BvYR0L6f2Ig_16	ANYWAY THE THIRD ONE I THINK IT WAS A MUCH MUCH BETTER IN THE SECOND ONE ANYWAY
W8NXH0Djyww_7	WAS A GREAT MOVIE
VCslbP0mgZI_15	SO IF I GIVES ACCESS TO THE BENEFIT THE DOUBT THIS IS A MOVIE THAT LOOKS GREAT HAS SOME BAD ACTING
9qR7uwkblbs_20	SHE CANT REALLY ACT LIKE ME AT ALL
2WGyTLYerpo_53	I WAS A HUGE FAN OF IT I
W8NXH0Djyww_10	THEY ALL PLAYED UP FOR EACH OTHER THEY
vvZ4IcEtiZc_1	AND I REALLY REALLY LOVED IT AND
9T9Hf74oK10_20	YOU DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
yDtzw_Y-7RU_16	AND THROUGHOUT THE FILM YOURE GOING EITHER FROM THE TERRIFYING CHARACTERS OR
vyB00TXsimI_6	SOME REALLY FUN TOUCHES WITHIN THE MOVIE IS STATUE OF VAMPIRES IN OTHER SHOWS APPEAR IN THIS MOVIE NOT AS VAMPIRES ONE
VbQk4H8hgr0_40	THE CHARACTERS JUST WERENT THE SAME AS THE FIRST TWO THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM AND
G6GlGvlkxAQ_5	I THINK ITS ACCOUNTABLE CHRIS HEMSWORTH BEING A BIGGER STAR
bvLlb-M3UXU_2	NOT A COMPELLING NARRATIVE BY ANY MEANS THERES
8OtFthrtaJM_15	INTERESTINGLY IT TURNED OUT TO BE MORE OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY THAT IT WAS A THRILLER
c7UH_rxdZv4_15	BORING
OQvJTdtJ2H4_3	A LITTLE LESS SPARKLY IT WAS VERY DISTRACTING
Oz06ZWiO20M_25	THE STORY IS ONE LIKE IS WHY PEOPLE BECAUSE HES ONE LIKE ITS THE MOVEMENT AND THE DANCING AND THE MUSIC AND THE SATS AND JIMMY SPIRITS
f9O3YtZ2VfI_9	IT DOESNT IT JUST ITS TOO MUCH CRAP IN HERE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_6	BUT THIS ONE WAS EARN I DONT KNOW I MEAN THIS STORY WAS THERE BUT I DONT KNOW
VCslbP0mgZI_7	ACTUALLY HAVE SOME SYMPTOMATICALLY HAS SOME COOL THEMES ABOUT TERRORISM AND ABOUT LIKE TAKING OWNERSHIP OF YOURSELF AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH I RESONATE WITH THE NIGHT WHICH WHICH I APPRECIATED
5W7Z1C_fDaE_5	MAKES BIG POWERFUL STATEMENTS AT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_15	BUT I TOTALLY MISSED HOW WOULD TIED INTO THE MOVIE AT ALL
WKA5OygbEKI_17	THIS REALLY QUIRKY LITTLE CHAMELEON
2WGyTLYerpo_45	AND SHES NOT A BAD ACTORS
nbWiPyCm4g0_9	I DONT KNOW WHO SHOT A STORYLINE MADE ME NEVER WANT TO HAVE KIDS NEVER ONCE HAVE RICH FRIENDS
BioHAh1qJAQ_18	ALL THOSE ACTION SEQUENCES AND INVOLVING THE GAMES WERE GREAT TO WATCH THE
HEsqda8_d0Q_32	ILL TELL YOU ABOUT LIKE FROM HERE AND STUFF
9J25DZhivz8_19	I MEAN MY STOMACH WAS ALMOST AS YOU WENT DOWN THE BIG DROP
nzpVDcQ0ywM_8	I THINK YOULL REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE EIGHT
VbQk4H8hgr0_17	THE DONKEY AND PUSS IN BOOTS RIVALRY THATS GOING ON IT JUST IT WASNT AS FUNNY THE THIRD TIME AROUND
c5xsKMxpXnc_11	YOU DONT SEE WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER
cXypl4FnoZo_5	I LIKED IT I THOUGHT KEVIN HARDWICK DID A GOOD JOB
Bfr499ggo-0_22	GOOD BUT IF YOU DONT EXPECT A LOT I THINK YOULL ENJOY IT
BI97DNYfe5I_13	HE WAS GOOD HE
2WGyTLYerpo_12	I DONT EXPECT THE ACTUALLY SOMETIMES
Ci-AH39fi3Y_42	ITS PRETTY MUCH JUST AN EXCUSE TO PUT TRAPS IN THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_22	BUT LIKE THATS KIND OF DEPRESSING
Sqr0AcuoNnk_3	AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
ob23OKe5a9Q_13	WE HAD A FEW PROBLEMS SO IT IS ONE THAT IVE LIKED IT
8d-gEyoeBzc_18	YOU CANT HAVE IT IN THERE WAS ENOUGH IN IT FOR YOU TO CARE ABOUT HIM
W8NXH0Djyww_26	THAT IS GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_35	MAN MAN IT REALLY LEFT THE DOOR OPEN
9qR7uwkblbs_16	I DONT KNOW I GUESS WE BOTH HAVE LIKE THAT LAKE MALES SOUNDING VOICE
tIrG4oNLFzE_9	WAIT A SECOND MY HEART I CAN COOK SHE HAD THE SAME
BvYR0L6f2Ig_20	I SEE THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES IVE SEEN HOW FAST
pLTX3ipuDJI_16	INCIDENTALLY I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE IS A RENTAL NO I DONT SEE IT BECAUSE ITS A LOW GREAT SEQUEL TO THE EIGHTY SEVEN VERSION AND ONLY IF YOU LIKE THIS
IumbAb8q2dM_16	AND I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO COME OUT
2iD-tVS8NPw_12	VERY MUCH A LIGHT HEARTED
G-xst2euQUc_12	SO WHAT IS STILL A REALLY GREAT MOVIE TAKE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO
OtBXNcAL_lE_23	AND ITS REALLY UNPREDICTABLE I
f9O3YtZ2VfI_15	AND SCALING DOWN OF LIKE TWO HOURS
2WGyTLYerpo_32	REALLY BAD 
fvVhgmXxadc_7	NOW IT ALSO TAKES A REALLY CREEPY ONLY TO THE FACT THAT SIMPLY GROUNDING IN THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE SHES UNDER AGE
G-xst2euQUc_6	I WAS I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT
QN9ZIUWUXsY_6	ARE THESE TWO THINGS POSSIBLE IN THE SAME SENTENCE RIGHT I REALLY DO THINK SO
0h-zjBukYpk_1	NOT THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE BASICALLY SAYS IT ALL
8qrpnFRGt2A_18	THE COURSE IS GOING TO BE MAKING THEM LOOK GOOD WHICH IS FINE
tmZoasNr4rU_15	A LOT MORE THAN THE EXPENDABLES BUT
Nzq88NnDkEk_3	I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT I WAS
Nzq88NnDkEk_21	IM GONNA SAY THIS ONE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE WAIT UNTIL IT COMES ON HBO OR
VbQk4H8hgr0_37	SO IT IS ONE OF THOSE CHARACTERS PRETTY POINTLESS
Oz06ZWiO20M_1	IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY AND STUPID FOR MOVIES THAT THIS REALLY LONG LIKE REALLY NOT REALLY LONG BUT LIKE REALLY INTENSE RANT ABOUT IT
VbQk4H8hgr0_2	I LOVE THE FIRST RECONCILE AND TRACK AND
bvLlb-M3UXU_21	SEEING IT TODAY NOW WHERE WAS REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN JUST A ONE UPSMANSHIP
BioHAh1qJAQ_9	BUT YOU KNOW IF THE PACING IS SO GREAT
HEsqda8_d0Q_12	EXPECTING THAT MUCH BECAUSE
73jzhE8R1TQ_10	AND THE NUMBER IS EIGHT NAN KIND OF STICK TO THE BOOK OF IT SIR SO I LIKE THAT AND
bOL9jKpeJRs_5	ITS REALLY JUST A HEARTWARMING STORY
jUzDDGyPkXU_18	THERE IS NO GOOD DIALOGUE NOTHING
Sqr0AcuoNnk_14	I LIKE TEARED UP IN FRANCE BUT THATS BECAUSE OF HIM
8d-gEyoeBzc_7	BUT IT ENJOYS
8qrpnFRGt2A_6	THE BIGGEST ONE IS THE C GI A FAX WERE JUST TERRIBLE
2WGyTLYerpo_24	AND ALSO I LIKE HOW ITS KIND OF UP FRONT TO SHOW THEM TO US INSTEAD OF HIDING THEM LIKE SHOWING A LITTLE LEG AND ARM ONE SCENE OR SOMETHING NO THEY JUST LIKE STRAIGHT UP SHOW TO US AND IM
BI97DNYfe5I_25	ITS ONE ITS ONE TO CHECK OUT THEATRES IVE I WOULD SAY
Bfr499ggo-0_14	AFTER FACTORED GET YOUR WRITING THE CAMELS ALL TRAPPED UP LOOKING LIKE CLOWNS
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_3	SO I REALLY WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THIS MOVIE
I5y0__X72p0_18	IT IS GOOD THAT LIKE
_dI--eQ6qVU_5	AND I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IT WAS HILARIOUS
c7UH_rxdZv4_4	SAY REALLY LOVE AN ACTION FLICK ACTION COMEDY FLICK EVEN BETTER RIGHT
6Egk_28TtTM_2	AND MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE MILO MILES MOTHER ENGLAND
VbQk4H8hgr0_21	DISAPPOINTINGLY HIGHLY AND
yDtzw_Y-7RU_7	SO IF THATS YOUR FORM OF CHRISTIANITY ITS A QUESTION FELT
atnd_PF-Lbs_12	PLEASE RESIST FROM THESE TWO
Clx4VXItLTE_19	I DONT HAVE A LOT OF TIMES
HEsqda8_d0Q_4	I WASNT EXPECTING TOO BECAUSE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_18	AND BASICALLY THIS MAKES NO SENSE
v0zCBqDeKcE_16	THIS IS KIND
WKA5OygbEKI_1	I REALLY ENJOY DOING THEM FOR THAT SILLY MOVIE CLUB SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT
WKA5OygbEKI_21	BUT IT WAS WORTH THE FREE MOVIE PASSES USED ON IT
nzpVDcQ0ywM_19	AND HIS PERFORMANCE IS CAMPY AND COMES OFF AS AN ARMY CHEERLEADER SOME OF THE TIME
Ci-AH39fi3Y_23	I SURE DIDNT SEE THE END COMING
W8NXH0Djyww_30	BUT THAT DIDNT REALLY MATTER
MLal-t_vJPM_16	THERES NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS THING
cW1FSBF59ik_7	[UNK]
Oz06ZWiO20M_13	I THINK ITS REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE A MUSICAL AND I
2WGyTLYerpo_2	ITS A LOT OF FUN
c7UH_rxdZv4_23	KATO IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS ANY GOOD WHATSOEVER IN
8OtFthrtaJM_23	BUT ITS JUST THE CREEPIEST OLD GUY YOULL EVER SEE IN YOUR LIFE HE STANDS OVER PEOPLE WHEN THEYRE SLEEP JUST STARING AT THEM
rnaNMUZpvvg_8	ALL THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST SO IM
0h-zjBukYpk_10	BUT YOU KNOW HE DID IT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_20	YOUR EYES ARE KIND LIKE THIS WELCOME TO THE POLAR EXPRESS
03bSnISJMiM_1	ANYHOW IT WAS REALLY GOOD
9T9Hf74oK10_16	I MEAN UNDER OTHER WORDS LIKE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE SHES JUST BEEN REALLY FANTASTIC AND
Qr1Ca94K55A_1	THIS MOVIE IS JUST RIDICULOUS AND I I THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_9	OLOGY AND WARNER BROTHERS IS NEVER GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_20	EXTREMELY WELL MADE ITS EXTREMELY
I5y0__X72p0_34	IT WASNT BAD
8qrpnFRGt2A_22	BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A CARTOON WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH MOSTLY IS WITH ALL THE C GI EFFECTS
I5y0__X72p0_5	THEY BOTH LIKED IT
7JsX8y1ysxY_2	SOME REALLY GOOD ACTING
d6hH302o4v8_6	WELL TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY
1iG0909rllw_25	MY FAVORITE SCENES DEFINITELY THATLL TORY
bOL9jKpeJRs_16	I THINK MY FAVORITE PART OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE WAS WHEN YOU FIND OUT AT THE END THAT THE LITTLE BABY HAD POWERS
f_pcplsH_V0_5	MY OVERALL OPINION OF THE RESULTS OF THIS PROCESS IN SCREAM THREE AND ACTUALLY
LSi-o-IrDMs_1	ITS ACTUALLY WORTH TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE
ZUXBRvtny7o_25	I WILL EVEN BE CAPPED THIS MOVIE ON BLU RAY
ZUXBRvtny7o_2	I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE THIS MOVIE
HEsqda8_d0Q_28	SOME OF US
atnd_PF-Lbs_1	ITS BEEN
pLTX3ipuDJI_7	BUT NOTHING SUCKS EITHER WHICH GIVES THE MOVIE SOME POINTS I GUESS
1DmNV9C1hbY_5	BUT YOU KNOW FOR THIS ONE I JUST DIDNT CARE
9T9Hf74oK10_8	A LOT OF CRITICS SAID THAT IT RELIED TOO MUCH ON THE AUDIENCE TO EXPLORE THE THEMES IN THE FILM AND YOU KNOW RIGHTLY SO I GUESS ITS
phBUpBr1hSo_21	MAYBE ON PAR WITH THE SECOND ONE MAYBE A LITTLE BEHIND THAT BUT IT WAS IT WAS PRETTY GOOD STORY
8d-gEyoeBzc_22	I STILL THINK IT WAS WELL DEVELOPED ENOUGH AND ITS ALSO INCLUDED IN THAT LAURENCE FISHBURNES CHARACTER AS WELL WHO
POKffnXeBds_8	HEY SHE MIGHT LIKE IT BUT EVEN THEN ITS NOT REALLY FUNNY AT ALL
etzxEpPuc6I_13	THERES ONE PART WITH THE GIRLS LIKE MY DADDY TAUGHT ME DONT WELL IT WAS THE GOOD ECONOMIC WOW LIKE THIS ACTING PRETTY BAD

OtBXNcAL_lE_19	SINGALONGS VIDEO BLAH BLAH BLAH IN THAT IT
2iD-tVS8NPw_28	ITS KIND OF INTERESTING TO SEE IF WHERE THEYRE GONNA BE GOING WITH THAT IM
wMbj6ajWbic_25	THE GUYS LOST A LOT OF FUN TO
aiEXnCPZubE_10	THE SUPPORTING CAST IS EITHER IT OR MISS
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_9	AND THE GOOD HUMOR IT DEEMS THAT THE MOVIE FOR BEING SO BAD THE DIALOGUE DEPARTMENT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_5	THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT ITS ALL TOLD IN FLASHBACK FROM A POINT JUST BEFORE KATRINA HITS NEW ORLEANS
cXypl4FnoZo_27	I WAS SAYING IF SHES NOT GONNA MARRY HIM I WILL
6_0THN4chvY_1	SO ITS KIND OF CURIOUS TO SEE MAYBE IF THATS WHAT DISNEY WAS GOING FOR AND IT DEFINITELY WAS WHAT THEY WERE GOING FOR
aiEXnCPZubE_6	ADDITIONALLY STUNNING
d6hH302o4v8_16	WHO IS VERY BORING
2WGyTLYerpo_49	THEY ARE BUT THEYRE NOT SHES GLARING FLAWS BUT
MLal-t_vJPM_3	YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR KIDS

Ci-AH39fi3Y_19	SO IT WAS JUST REALLY REALLY STRANGE
zhpQhgha_KU_20	HE DOES HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES
5W7Z1C_fDaE_9	ITS A HUGE BREAKTHROUGH FOR KEVIN SMITH ITS

9qR7uwkblbs_2	ACTUALLY REALLY  LOVE THIS MOVIE
cW1FSBF59ik_17	SHE WAS  EPIC
d3_k5Xpfmik_17	BUT ITS A VERY KIND OF THEM STYLISTIC EDGE ON EIGHT
LSi-o-IrDMs_27	AGAIN WE GET BURNED OUT ON THREE BECAUSE ITS
c7UH_rxdZv4_19	YOU CANT EVEN TELL FUNNY JOKES
7JsX8y1ysxY_11	ITS KIND OF WEIRD
BXuRRbG0Ugk_21	IN A MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS DANIEL CRAIGS STEALS THE WHOLE DANG SHOW
G6GlGvlkxAQ_16	WELL WHEN YOU GET SICK COMES IN TERMS OF COMIC BOOKS AND COMIC MOVIES IT TAKES AWHILE FOR THE FELT THAT
8OtFthrtaJM_19	BUT JUST ASIDE FROM THAT THEY REALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THE SUSPENSEFUL PARTS
1DmNV9C1hbY_14	I DIDNT CARE FOR IT BUT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_9	THEY COULD IT KIND OF GET A LITTLE BIT OF CHRIS HEMSWORTHS STAR POWER INTO THAT
cXypl4FnoZo_9	SO THE MORE LIKE WOMEN DIRECTORS AND I SEE YOU KNOW I I I LIKE SEEING THAT
I5y0__X72p0_22	I ID AT THE END OF THE MOVIE THE FRIENDS I WAS WITH A WOMAN GOES WAS THERE A PLOT TO THIS MOVIE
_dI--eQ6qVU_10	AND THE HUMOR IT WAS KIND OF NECESSARY
vyB00TXsimI_10	YEAH THATS ABOUT HOW MY FAVORITES LIST GOES
jUzDDGyPkXU_22	MOMENTS WHERE HE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST SOUNDED DUMB AS HELL
ZUXBRvtny7o_33	BECAUSE ITS WORKED

lXPQBPVc5Cw_21	THE BEGINNING START OFF GREAT WITH COUPLE GOOD JOKES

nbWiPyCm4g0_5	ALSO IF YOURE STRAIGHT MAN YOU VOLUNTARILY WILLINGLY GO AND SEE THIS FILM IM GONNA NEED YOU SOON LIGHT A CANDLE SAY A PRAYER AND ASK YOURSELF SOME QUESTIONS
BioHAh1qJAQ_14	THE SPECIAL EFFECTS LOOK AMAZING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_17	AND FINALLY A PARTICULAR STANDOUT SCENE FOR ME WAS THE FIGHTER JETS SEQUENCE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_4	ALL IN ALL ITS KIND OF A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ANY OF US WHO GREW UP IN THE EIGHTIES AND ARE USED TO THE TOYS IN THE CARTOON
Clx4VXItLTE_23	SOME LIKE WELL I DO LIKE IF I JUMP A LAUGH
9J25DZhivz8_15	SAY YES
