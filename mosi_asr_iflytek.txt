BXuRRbG0Ugk_29	AND THE ACTORS DO SUCH A GOOD JOB OF CARRYING OUT THEIR PARTICULAR ROCKS
nbWiPyCm4g0_6	THIS IS REALLY JUST A CONTINUATION OF THE FIRST FILM
QN9ZIUWUXsY_2	AND I DONT THINK THATS A VERY GOOD MOVIE
ZUXBRvtny7o_12	LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE IT STARTS WITH REALLY GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES
bOL9jKpeJRs_27	YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
Bfr499ggo-0_1	MOST OF THE CRITICS ARE RIGHT
c7UH_rxdZv4_20	AND CAMERON DIAZ WHOSE SUPPOSED TO BE PLUCKY I GUESS ITS KIND OF USELESS
1iG0909rllw_18	WOMEN ARE EVEN WITH A BIGGER BETTER BUDGET IT WAS STILL TOO LONG
BvYR0L6f2Ig_20	OH SO THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES IVE SEEN OUT OF US
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_11	OVERALL I ENJOYED IT
dq3Nf_lMPnE_1	AND GROWTH IN THE CHARACTERS ITS USUALLY A PATH OF DISCOVERY
OtBXNcAL_lE_20	UM YEAH SO ANYWAYS ITS REALLY PREDICTABLE
d6hH302o4v8_33	IT WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA
bvLlb-M3UXU_4	AND YET THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLY ENJOYABLE FOR ACTION FANS
HEsqda8_d0Q_23	OF TOES AND TO GO AND SEE THAT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_19	MAKES IT LOOK TOO TOO GOOD
ZUXBRvtny7o_2	I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MOVIE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_9	COLLEGE IN WARNER BROTHERS IS NEVER GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE
X3j2zQgwYgE_9	BUT BLACK YOU KNOW VERY LACKLUSTER
G-xst2euQUc_5	AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED ABOUT THIS MOVIE
BI97DNYfe5I_31	TOO PRETTY INTENSE AT THE END
2WGyTLYerpo_21	REALLY STRONG
cW1FSBF59ik_14	IM MARVEL ONCE AGAIN DECIDED TO TOSS ANOTHER RANDOM PAGE IN THIS MOVIE
Clx4VXItLTE_31	THERE IS PEOPLE THAT WANNA GO AND SEE IT HAVENT SEEN IT YET IN THE MIDST OF THIS VIDEO
yDtzw_Y-7RU_2	THIS FILM IS SLAVISH LI DEVOTED TO THE ORIGINAL BOOK WHERE NOVEL NOVELLA UH BY UH CHARLES DICKENS
Oz06ZWiO20M_8	BUT ITS NOT BAD I THINK THE WAY MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING ITS BETTER
G6GlGvlkxAQ_14	BUT THE AUDIENCE THAT WAS WATCHING IT BEING ABLE TO PAY OFF RIGHT AWAY
G-xst2euQUc_14	HAD NO IDEA THAT ANNE HATHAWAY COULD REALLY SING IT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_26	THE ENDING WAS NOT YOU KNOW CRAZY SHOCKING OR ANYTHING LIKE USUAL
Njd1F0vZSm4_1	IM GOING TO GIVE THIS A GRADE B MINUS
WKA5OygbEKI_19	IF YOU DONT REALLY HAVE ANY SMALL FRIENDS UH THAT SOUNDED REALLY PERVERTED SMALL CHILDREN THAT YOU ARE RELATED TO UM TO TAKE TO THE MOVIES I WOULDNT GO SEE IT BY MYSELF

v0zCBqDeKcE_9	I THINK THEYRE VERY GOOD ACTORS YOU KNOW
etzxEpPuc6I_9	AS WITH GI JOE WAS IT WAS JUST LIKE ITS THE PLOT THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE
2WGyTLYerpo_42	YOU CAN CARE ABOUT HIM
G-xst2euQUc_4	IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN PRODUCTION COMPANIES START PUSHING MOVIES THAT FAR AHEAD OF WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED THAT USUALLY MEANS THAT THEYRE NOT GOING TO BE GREAT
Nzq88NnDkEk_23	UM I JUST REALLY DO NOT LIKE IT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_28	BUT AND ITS A GOOD STORY
d6hH302o4v8_31	HE LIKES P O C GI REALLY

5W7Z1C_fDaE_23	DEFINITELY GOT SOME FUN KEVIN SMITH MOMENTS IN IT FOR YOU TO LAUGH WITH AH
9T9Hf74oK10_11	AND I THINK THAT THE MOVIE DID RELY ON YOU TO KIND OF FIGURE IT OUT AND KIND OF DEAL WITH THOSE IDEAS BY YOURSELF
IumbAb8q2dM_15	UM HE WROTE A GOOD BOOK
Nzq88NnDkEk_14	BECAUSE I WAS A KID BACK IN THE DAY BUT MEDUSA WAS A LOT SCARY THATS SCARIER THEN
jUzDDGyPkXU_20	THEY SAY JUST SOUNDS SO FUCKING STUPID
9qR7uwkblbs_2	ACTUALLY REALLY FUCKING LOVE THIS MOVIE
Nzq88NnDkEk_7	I THINK THE MUSIC THEY COME UP WITH THE SOUNDTRACK REALLY GOT ME EXCITED ABOUT SEEING THIS MOVIE AND
c7UH_rxdZv4_33	DONT SEE IT
etzxEpPuc6I_6	THEY HAVE A LOT OF ADULT SITUATIONS IN IT
ZAIRrfG22O0_9	BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY FAR BETTER MOVIES THAT YOU CAN UH GO SEE THEN UM THAN TO KEEP A SO THANK YOU
c7UH_rxdZv4_2	REALLY BAD MOVIE
tmZoasNr4rU_13	NO I I I I GUESS SO I MEAN ITS ITS IT WAS ANNOYING
VbQk4H8hgr0_13	THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL THE SAME AND
etzxEpPuc6I_14	BUT THEY THEY THEY KNEW IT WAS JUST A MOVIE BUT UH A A DOLL SO THEN THEY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY EITHER
1iG0909rllw_9	AND I I DIDNT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM NAMING UM IN TERMS OF HIS DIRECTION
IumbAb8q2dM_14	UH AND IT TURNS OUT THAT JAMES FREY WHO UM I REALLY LIKE HE
BI97DNYfe5I_29	THATS PRETTY SERIOUS AND
Ci-AH39fi3Y_15	BUT I TOTALLY MISSED HOW IT TIED INTO THE MOVIE AT ALL
8d-gEyoeBzc_22	UM I STILL THINK HE WAS WELL DEVELOPED ENOUGH AND UH ALSO I INCLUDE IN THAT LAURENCE FISHBURNE CHARACTER AS WELL WHO
9T9Hf74oK10_4	THERE IS A CERTAIN DEADPAN NATURE TO IT
8d-gEyoeBzc_11	I I LIKE TO EAT HAMBURGERS CARROTS
_dI--eQ6qVU_8	BE FUNNY ABOUT THIS MOVIE BIG TIME TOTALLY
1iG0909rllw_11	THING IS ITS A VERY GOOD TRANSLATION OF THE BOOK
VbQk4H8hgr0_22	I WAS JUST SO DISCOURAGED AFTER SEEING THAT MOVIE AND I
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_16	SUFFERS FROM WHAT I CALL A KINGDOM OF HEAVEN SYNDROME WHERE IT BUILDS TOO MUCH FOR THESE HUGE CATASTROPHIC WAR SEQUENCES ARE SUPPOSED TO BLOW YOU AWAY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS YOU DONT GIVE A DAMN BECAUSE IT JUST LACKS THAT CHARM OF THE PAST MOVIES UM
7JsX8y1ysxY_13	ALRIGHT SO ENOUGH OF THE NUDITY
lXPQBPVc5Cw_21	THE BEGINNING STARTED OFF GREAT WITH A COUPLE OF GOOD JOKES
PZ-lDQFboO8_5	NOW IM NOT GOING TO LIE THERE ARE A FEW PARTS THAT HAVE GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES NOW EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN ANIMATED FILM IT DID HAVE SOME GREAT FIGHT SCENES
6_0THN4chvY_6	OH MY GOD GREAT JOKES
HEsqda8_d0Q_9	LIKE WHAT A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
cXypl4FnoZo_4	I THOUGHT IT COULD BE REALLY BAD UM BUT IT DIDNT LOOK LIKE IT WOULD BE BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN
Oz06ZWiO20M_18	FUNNY DIALOGUE MAYBE
_dI--eQ6qVU_3	I DONT KNOW IF FANS OF THE COMIC WOULD BE AS INCLINED TO SAY THE SAME BECAUSE I DONT KNOW HOW MUCH IT DIFFERS FROM THE COMIC OR THE RADIO PROGRAM THAT PEOPLE LIKE SO MUCH
bOL9jKpeJRs_3	GREAT DIALOGUE
rnaNMUZpvvg_7	I HONESTLY WANTED THE ALIENS TO WIN
BioHAh1qJAQ_12	YOU HAVE NEW CHARACTERS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE OLD ONES
aiEXnCPZubE_1	IS MEDIOCRE ON A ROLL
1iG0909rllw_6	IT WAS REALLY ENJOYABLE I WAS
Qr1Ca94K55A_8	LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT HAD TACKY ONE LINERS THAT WERE JUST HYSTERICAL DID
I5y0__X72p0_7	NOW I GOTTA SAY I WASNT BLOWN AWAY BY IT
2iD-tVS8NPw_14	YOU KNOW GOING INTO IT OR AT LEAST WATCHING THE TRAILERS BEFORE AND I WAS REALLY KIND OF HESITANT ABOUT SEEING THE GREEN LANTERN IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE
1DmNV9C1hbY_8	THEY WERE JUST FLAT
W8NXH0Djyww_4	AND THIS TOWN WAS LIKE FROM A GOOD OLD WESTERN
8d-gEyoeBzc_10	BUT UM I WOULD SAY THAT UM THERE WAS AT LEAST GOOD FOR THOSE FOUR CHARACTERS IN THERE
vyB00TXsimI_2	IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE THAT HAS ANYTHING REALISTIC IN IT YOU SHOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS INSANE
9qR7uwkblbs_1	WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL RYAN GOSLING LEATHER SHOE AND SUIT PORN
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_5	I DIDNT MIND IT
2WGyTLYerpo_17	THE ACTION IS REALLY COOL PEOPLE
2WGyTLYerpo_57	BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST FEELS INTO LIKE CLICHE ACTION MOVIE TERRITORY AGAIN
6_0THN4chvY_2	BUT I BET IF YOU PUT THEM NEXT TO THE NEW FILM THE OTHER SIDE WOULD BE SIMILAR ENOUGH THAT THAT YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO REALLY TELL WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS
9T9Hf74oK10_19	BUT ANYWAYS THEY DID UH THEY DID ACT VERY WELL
8qrpnFRGt2A_3	SO I DIDNT HAVE VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS MOVIE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_4	AND YOU PUT THEM IN VERY STRANGE AND UNUSUAL CHARACTERS WE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_15	I THINK UH WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THIS WAS THAT HE REALLY TRIED VERY HARD TO MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL
cW1FSBF59ik_23	ON WAIT I LOVE THE SCENE DO THOSE WOLVERINE INTO THE TRUCKS THAT FEEL GOOD JACK OFF UM
cXypl4FnoZo_6	AND UM I LIKE YOU KNOW KEVIN HART LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW KIND OF RIDICULOUS
Qr1Ca94K55A_12	I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GOING TO BE MORE THAN THAT BUT SO I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THAT UM
etzxEpPuc6I_12	OK SO THIS IS A LIE
c5xsKMxpXnc_9	YOU DONT FEEL THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER
d6hH302o4v8_1	THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_6	I DIDNT NEED ANY OF THAT CORRECT
5W7Z1C_fDaE_5	BIG POWERFUL STATEMENTS
atnd_PF-Lbs_5	I HATE IT
d3_k5Xpfmik_18	ITS ALMOST LIKE IMAGINE IF TARANTINO DIRECTED A ZOMBIE MOVIE
cW1FSBF59ik_7	NOISE
0h-zjBukYpk_17	AND HE ALMOST LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS HIS CHARACTER IN DEFIANCE
f_pcplsH_V0_10	I THINK THIS ONE DID BEAT SCREAM TOO NOW
OQvJTdtJ2H4_10	WHAT ABOUT STARS
9J25DZhivz8_7	THE STORY HAD ELEMENTS OF IT BUT THIS MOVIE PLAYED WITH 3D AND ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO COME AT YOU OUT OF THE SCREEN
BXuRRbG0Ugk_15	I MEAN YEAH HES A COMPETENT ACTION DIRECTOR
lXPQBPVc5Cw_10	UM ITS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES WHERE MOST OF THE FUNNY PARTS ARE IN THE COMMERCIAL SO YOU LIKE THAT MOVIE HAS TO BE AWESOME AND YOU GO AND YOU KNOW YOUVE SEEN THE COMMERCIALS SO MANY TIMES THAT PART ISNT EVEN FUNNY ANYMORE AND THEN YOURE WONDERING WHERE THE HELL IS THE REST OF IT
phBUpBr1hSo_20	I DONT THINK IT WAS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE OBVIOUSLY I THINK I THINK THE FIRST MOVIE WAS JUST FANTASTIC
etzxEpPuc6I_1	UM SO CHANNING TATUM AND MARLON ARE TRANSPORTING IT THEY GET AMBUSHED BY UM COBRA ITS KIND OF HARD TO EXPLAIN BECAUSE
rnaNMUZpvvg_9	MICHAEL JUST THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHARACTER THE DOCTOR HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON I EVEN REALLY CARED ABOUT
9T9Hf74oK10_15	AND KAREN NIGHTLY I MEAN EVERYBODY KNOWS IT FROM PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN BUT
QN9ZIUWUXsY_4	I CAN TELL YOU THAT TRON LEGACY IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE
bOL9jKpeJRs_9	AND UH
lXPQBPVc5Cw_13	VOICE ACTING WAS PHENOMENAL
03bSnISJMiM_11	NOISE
f_pcplsH_V0_4	BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE HAVING HELL BE ABLE TO BE EVERYWHERE IF THERES TWO OF THEM
9qR7uwkblbs_11	BEST PART OF THE FUCKING ASS MOVIE WAS THIS ONE SCENE WHERE RYAN GOSLING IS JUST STANDING THERE IN A FUCKING SUIT EATING PIZZA IN SLOW AS MOTION
2WGyTLYerpo_12	DIDNT EXPECT THE ACTION TO BE SO INTENSE
cXypl4FnoZo_27	I WAS SAYING IF SHES NOT GOING TO MARRY HIM I WILL
BI97DNYfe5I_15	HE DID A GREAT JOB
vyB00TXsimI_1	BUT I DO WANNA TELL YOU ABOUT PRIEST
8OtFthrtaJM_1	WHICH IS WHERE ALL GREAT RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD START
2iD-tVS8NPw_29	LOOKING FORWARD TO IT I GOT TO SAY IT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_7	YOU KNOW A MOVIE IS TERRIBLE WHEN A PERSON IS TRYING TO REVIEW IT DOESNT EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY BUT I DONT KNOW THIS MOVIE WAS
bOL9jKpeJRs_26	NOISE
VCslbP0mgZI_15	SO IF I GIVE ZACK SNYDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THIS IS A MOVIE THAT LOOKS GREAT HAS SOME BAD ACTING
2WGyTLYerpo_26	IT WAS REALLY COOL WHEN THEY DID THAT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_5	I JUST DONT THINK IT WAS VERY GOOD
tIrG4oNLFzE_15	AS AN ACTOR I REALLY THINK ESPECIALLY ACTING THE LEADING ROLE YOU REALLY SHOULD PREPARE FOR THAT ROLE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_15	I ALSO LOVE THE CASTING OF MARK STRONG THIS SEMESTER OH HES
9c67fiY0wGQ_10	PARENTS WILL FIND THEMSELVES LAUGHING AS THEY REMINISCE THEIR CHILDHOOD
VbQk4H8hgr0_23	DEFINITELY WISH I HAD MY MONEY BACK
BXuRRbG0Ugk_25	AND FORD IS ALONG FOR THE RIDE AND HAVING A BLAST AS THE SECOND LEAD
LSi-o-IrDMs_2	THE MOVIE ITSELF IS THE SAME OLD CRAP FROM THE SERIES
d3_k5Xpfmik_7	THE WHILE IT ALSO MAINTAINS ITS KIND OF UH DETACHED UM SATIRE OF THE GENERA
HEsqda8_d0Q_10	AND ITS ALL KIND OF ITS HARD TO EXPLAIN
cXypl4FnoZo_29	I DIDNT LIKE PETER
0h-zjBukYpk_3	MY REASON I AM A COMIC BOOK FAN
W8NXH0Djyww_15	ALL THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IN THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT LIKE
LSi-o-IrDMs_6	THE ACTING IS BAD THE
7JsX8y1ysxY_23	I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY COOL
2WGyTLYerpo_22	KIND OF SCARY LOOKING
v0zCBqDeKcE_5	IT IS SUCH A FEEL GOOD COMEDY
d3_k5Xpfmik_5	ZOMBIE LAND IS A REALLY SUCCESSFUL HORROR COMEDY AS
2WGyTLYerpo_35	AND HE DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB ALSO
9J25DZhivz8_13	AND THERE WAS MAYBE ONE TIME WHEN I THOUGHT I ACTUALLY HEARD RUSSELL BRAND HIMSELF
atnd_PF-Lbs_3	IM NOT EVEN GOING TO GO TO THE LOWES TO MAKE A WHOLE NINE MINUTE VIDEO ABOUT THIS MOVIE
2iD-tVS8NPw_28	ITS KIND OF INTERESTING TO SEE UH WHERE THEYRE GONNA BE GOING WITH THE TIMES
8qrpnFRGt2A_21	IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A LIVE ACTION MOVIE YOURE GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED
wMbj6ajWbic_26	THAT WAY I THINK HAD A LOT OF FUN
d3_k5Xpfmik_17	BUT ITS A VERY KIND OF STYLISTIC EDGE ON IT
7JsX8y1ysxY_39	BUT YOU KNOW WERE ALWAYS GOOD
LSi-o-IrDMs_22	AND IT MAKES IT WORTH GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOUVE GOT OTHER DOBIE 3D SOMEWHERE IN YOUR IN YOUR TOWN
OtBXNcAL_lE_10	I LOVE THIS MOVIE
OQvJTdtJ2H4_4	IT WAS VERY HARD TO FOLLOW
f9O3YtZ2VfI_13	WE DID NOT NEED THE ENTIRE SPAN IS BURNT TO DEATH
I5y0__X72p0_19	THEY CONVINCED ME LIKE THIS CHICK COULD PROBABLY TAKE THAT DUDE DOWN WHICH IS PRETTY HARD BECAUSE
Clx4VXItLTE_11	UM SOME OF THE ACTING IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE OH MY GOD REALLY DO THAT BUT
_dI--eQ6qVU_15	THEY JUST COME UP WITH THESE TOTALLY COMPLETELY NEW STYLIZED WAYS OF DEVELOPING ACTION SEQUENCES
73jzhE8R1TQ_16	MEDIA LOOK LIKE THAT MOVIE WAS ALSO A COMMERCIAL IN THAT ASPECT
cW1FSBF59ik_11	HE CERTAINLY DOESNT FIT THE BILL EITHER ANY MARBLES UM ZERO
BvYR0L6f2Ig_17	MY LITTLE ONE SAID OH MY GOD SHE IS A TERRIFIC ITS JUST NICE LOOKING
Oz06ZWiO20M_19	THEN COMPELLING IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS COMPELLING AND THEN HAVE A STORY THATS LIKE AT FIVE MINUTES THIS HAPPENS IN 10 MINUTES THIS HAPPENS THAT MOVES FORWARD IT HAS MOMENTUM
dq3Nf_lMPnE_9	GONE ARE THE WICKEDLY SATIRICAL SEND UPS OF THE WORLD OF FAIRY TALES
rnaNMUZpvvg_15	HOWEVER HE WAS JUST LIKE A PLOT DEVICE FOR THIS OTHER GUY TOO START ACTING LIKE A FATHER FIGURE AND IT WAS JUST STUPID BUT THEN HE DIDNT EVEN ACT LIKE A FATHER FIGURE TOWARDS HIM HE
8qrpnFRGt2A_10	AH THIS MOVIE THIS MOVIE UM ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH I WAS CHECKING THE TIME AND SAW THAT THIS MOVIE IS TWO HOURS LONG
tStelxIAHjw_9	I DIDNT THINK IT WAS CUTE
OQvJTdtJ2H4_13	BUT THE SCENERY WAS GREAT AND
LSi-o-IrDMs_13	A TERRIBLE PICTURE BUT
wMbj6ajWbic_1	I REALLY WANTED TO SEE IT ACTUALLY BUT

G6GlGvlkxAQ_20	WHY ARE THEY HERE
c7UH_rxdZv4_32	YEAH SKIP IT
9T9Hf74oK10_20	YOU DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
Ci-AH39fi3Y_33	SO FIVE LEFT LIKE NO CLOSURE AT ALL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE
9T9Hf74oK10_9	UM IN A WAY A LOT OF THE THEMES AND NEVER LET ME GO WHICH WERE VERY PROFOUND AND DEEP
W8NXH0Djyww_26	UH IT WAS GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY UM
nzpVDcQ0ywM_6	IT WAS REALLY KIND OF DOWN DOWN FOR US
c5xsKMxpXnc_10	AND IT IS VERY RUSHED
WKA5OygbEKI_12	YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS TO BRING WITH YOU
0h-zjBukYpk_20	BUT THE TWO BIG CHARACTER APPEARANCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE EASILY DEAD POOL AND GAMBIT
v0zCBqDeKcE_14	NO PLEASE I LOVE MOVIES
Sqr0AcuoNnk_17	AND SHE LOOKS LIKE A ZELDA AND HELEN HUNT FROM THE TWISTER MOVIE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_25	SO I THINK THAT WAS REALLY GOOD
2iD-tVS8NPw_1	BEFORE I WENT IN TO SEE THE GREEN LANTERN IVE BEEN HEARING ALL THESE CRITICS BASICALLY JUST TRASH IN THIS MOVIE LEFT AND RIGHT I WAS
2WGyTLYerpo_24	AND ALSO I LIKE HOW ITS KIND OF FUN TO SHOW THEM TO US INSTEAD OF HIDING THEM LIKE SHOWING A LITTLE LIKE AN ARM ONE SCENE OR SOMETHING NO THEY JUST LIKE STRAIGHT UP SHOW IT TO US AND I WOULD
Nzq88NnDkEk_10	I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A RUSHED MOVIE
v0zCBqDeKcE_15	I LOVE ALL ASPECTS OF MOVIES
HEsqda8_d0Q_26	EVEN THOUGH I WAS LIKE OH GOD I HATE IT
iiK8YX8oH1E_16	I DONT USUALLY LIKE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_22	START CHEWING THE SCENERY LIKE ITS A 2 STEAK
1iG0909rllw_29	THE REST OF THE FILM WAS JUST WATCHING CHRISTIAN JUST MOVE AROUND
6_0THN4chvY_4	UM BE GREAT FOR KIDS TOO
VbQk4H8hgr0_4	AND IT JUST PLAIN DIDNT HAVE ANYTHING NEW TO OFFER
tmZoasNr4rU_15	A LOT MORE THAN THE EXPANDABLE BUT

Jkswaaud0hk_11	BUT IT WAS UH IN A GOOD TASTE
W8NXH0Djyww_9	ALL THE ANIMALS WERE JUST SO FUNNY
MLal-t_vJPM_7	ITS A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH
9qR7uwkblbs_14	AND I WAS REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT BECAUSE
1iG0909rllw_26	THAT MOMENT ON SCREEN MUST GUESS I MEAN THEY WERENT REALLY WENT IN THERE A LOT WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS FUN IT WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD
iiK8YX8oH1E_5	UM IT KIND OF FOLLOWS THE PATH OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING IN 1997 JULIA ROBERTS MOVIE EXCEPT IT TAKES 30 MINUTES LONGER TO DEVIATE FROM THE SCRIPT OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING
G-xst2euQUc_2	I DID NOT THINK I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT
GWuJjcEuzt8_5	SHE STILL LOOKS LIKE SHES 48
tmZoasNr4rU_18	THE
d3_k5Xpfmik_16	THE SEQUENCES WERE REALLY WELL DONE AND I
2iD-tVS8NPw_5	THIS IS A MOVIE THAT YOURE GOING TO GO OUT AND SEE
cW1FSBF59ik_21	AND YOU PROBABLY DID THE BEST PORTRAYAL OF SANDWICHES EVER
G6GlGvlkxAQ_17	UH WHY IS THIS PERSON WEARING TIGHTS
6_0THN4chvY_3	UM ITS ITS GREAT IF YOU REMEMBER THOSE OLD FILMS
Iu2PFX3z_1s_13	IN YOUR FACE
GWuJjcEuzt8_2	WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE SHES GOT A CRAZY CRAZY BOYS
TvyZBvOMOTc_10	EVEN THOUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE IS BASED ON WHETHER SHE GETS DOUBLE IN TIME YOURE NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE GETS THERE
I5y0__X72p0_30	SO IT WAS AN INTERESTING MOVIE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_5	GONNA HAPPEN IN SHREK 12 AND THREE ARE WIPED AWAY
ZUXBRvtny7o_7	THE SOUNDTRACK IS GOOD ITS REALLY GOOD SOME REALLY GREAT SONGS
HEsqda8_d0Q_6	BUT I THOUGHT IT ACTUALLY WORKED PRETTY WELL
1iG0909rllw_24	AND YOU SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN LAUGHING
BvYR0L6f2Ig_6	UM BUT SOME OF THE BRUSH PLOT THAT YOU MAY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE
8OtFthrtaJM_23	BUT HES JUST THE CREEPIEST OLD GUY YOULL EVER SEE IN YOUR LIFE HEAT STANDS OVER PEOPLE WHEN THEYRE ASLEEP JUST STARING AT THEM
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_12	THERE WAS A KEVIN COSTNER PRINCE OF THIEVES VERSION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DARK AND EDGY VERSION OF ITS TIME BUT I MEAN THAT WAS WHAT 13 YEARS AGO 40 YEARS AGO PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_4	AND THERE ARE TIMES THAT I WAS JUST SITTING THERE AFTER THEY SAID THEIR JOKES AND I WAS LIKE THATS NOT NOBODYS LAUGHING ITS NOT FUNNY
f_pcplsH_V0_3	THEYRE BACK TO HAVING TWO KILLERS THANKFULLY
vyB00TXsimI_14	THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TYPES OF MOVIES ARE
MLal-t_vJPM_11	ONE IM GETTING A LITTLE SICK OF THE MICHAEL SARAH KIND OF LEAD CHARACTER THE SORT OF REALLY AWKWARD BOY WHO IS REALLY AWKWARD IN STUFF YOU KNOW IM GETTING SICK OF THAT CHARACTER AND IM TIRED OF HIM AND
wMbj6ajWbic_15	I DID LIKE TRANSFORMERS TWO EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDNT LIKE THAT
I5y0__X72p0_37	I DID LIKE KIND OF LIKE THE ACTION
atnd_PF-Lbs_4	SO NO NOW KNOW THIS I AM NOT A FAN OF THE FINAL DESTINATION SERIES
I5y0__X72p0_16	BUT ITS NOT GREAT ITS
6Egk_28TtTM_6	AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR AGES THREE AND UP
Jkswaaud0hk_18	YOU LADIES GO TOGETHER TO SEE IT TOGETHER SO
2WGyTLYerpo_38	IT GIVES AN ENTERTAINING PERFORMANCE AS THE KIND OF LIKE THE LEADER THE OF THE TOWN
VbQk4H8hgr0_47	THE SECOND SEQUEL WAS REALLY GREAT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_4	MY EIGHT YEAR OLD WAS TERRIFIED TO BE PART OF THIS BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL VERSION IS TERRIFYING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_24	THESE TWO DEVELOPMENTS TOGETHER CAUSE WHAT WAS UP TO THAT POINT A NOBLE EFFORT TO START FALLING APART AT THE SEAMS AND
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_13	AND THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY SURE IT IS
lXPQBPVc5Cw_24	I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY
BI97DNYfe5I_11	AND ALL THE ACTION SCENES WERE GREAT
k5Y_838nuGo_17	THERE HAD ADULT HUMOR IN THEM
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_13	IT JUST LACKED THE CHARM OF THOSE PAST MOVIES
vvZ4IcEtiZc_7	AND I THINK THAT BLUE VALENTINE HAS UM BECOME KIND OF UNDERRATED
lXPQBPVc5Cw_8	UH JOHNNY DEPP DOING THE VOICE WAS FANTASTIC
ZAIRrfG22O0_4	BUT AFTER AN HOUR I JUST SAID ENOUGH I HAD TO WALK OUT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_18	ALSO ABOUT THE ANIMATION THE PEOPLE JUST LIKE IN POLAR EXPRESS A FILM I REALLY DID NOT LIKE
Vj1wYRQjB-o_1	WELL HE PLAYS THAT WELL SO HES A GOOD VILLAIN

WKA5OygbEKI_20	I DEFINITELY WONT BUY IT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_11	IT WASNT THERE
vyB00TXsimI_21	I LAUGHED AT QUITE A BIT OF THE DIALOGUE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_17	UM IT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE FILMS THATS NOT GOING TO BE EASY FOR YOU TO FIND IT
8OtFthrtaJM_9	BUT I MUST SAY THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY BIG SHOES TO FILL SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IT HAS A CHANCE I
9J25DZhivz8_11	I COULD I COULDNT EVEN BELIEVE IT WAS RUSSELL BRAND
X3j2zQgwYgE_3	UM SHES NOT FAIR
aiEXnCPZubE_20	THEY YOU KNOW THEY THEY BRING NOTHING TO THE TABLE
d6hH302o4v8_17	MAKE NO SENSE
I5y0__X72p0_18	IT IS GOOD THOUGH LIKE
Clx4VXItLTE_12	THATS LIKE ALL MOVIES ITS JUST LIKE WHAT A BAD CUSTOMER
I5y0__X72p0_23	IT DOESNT HAVE A DEEP SEATED PLOT
2WGyTLYerpo_2	THERES A LOT OF FUN
Ci-AH39fi3Y_29	THATS NOT TO SAY THAT THE ENDING WASNT GOOD BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS
nbWiPyCm4g0_10	MIRANDA MIRANDA WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS
8qrpnFRGt2A_25	I MEAN ITS ITS ABOUT THAT LEVEL OF STAR WARS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_22	STORM SHADOW IS VERY COOL HERE
Qr1Ca94K55A_2	PRACTICE IS PRETTY BAD
tStelxIAHjw_8	I DIDNT THINK IT WAS FUNNY
rnaNMUZpvvg_4	BUT ITS JUST SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY FOR THEM LIKE WHEN I SEE A MOVIE THATS OBVIOUSLY HAD A VERY BIG BUDGET AND ITS LIKE NOT EVEN GOOD IT MAKES ME ANGRY CAUSE IM JUST LIKE WHY ARE YOU WASTING SO MUCH MONEY
rnaNMUZpvvg_16	BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY A COMPLETE DOUCHE BAG WHO JUST
Clx4VXItLTE_1	AND IT IS JOHN PEOPLE WHO DONT LIKE SCARED OR JUMPING ON IT
ob23OKe5a9Q_5	AND UH
d3_k5Xpfmik_1	PERSON WHO HAVE NAMED THEMSELVES AFTER THE PLACES TO WHICH THEYRE TRAVELING WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY NICE TO WATCH HIM IS
Njd1F0vZSm4_3	THE FLYING SEQUENCES ARE BEAUTIFUL
Bfr499ggo-0_22	GOOD BUT IF YOU DONT EXPECT A LOT I THINK YOULL ENJOY IT
Bfr499ggo-0_19	BUT DONT EXPECT MUCH
73jzhE8R1TQ_6	SO YEAH AND THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY GOOD IN MY OPINION
cW1FSBF59ik_1	PROBABLY WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THEM FAILED MOST FAILED

8d-gEyoeBzc_20	UH WE HAD SOME FUNNY AND A FEW ONE LINERS A LITTLE QUIET AND ITS QUITE FUNNY
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_4	THE ACTING WAS ALRIGHT
2WGyTLYerpo_55	AND SOMETIMES IT KIND OF EARS INTO CLICHE ACTION MOVIE TERRITORY
dq3Nf_lMPnE_6	NOT A BAD IDEA FOR A SEQUEL
iiK8YX8oH1E_18	SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY REALISTIC CHARACTER HERE
Njd1F0vZSm4_13	OR YOU CAN SEE UP TO YOU
yDtzw_Y-7RU_6	BECAUSE THIS IS A FILM THAT BASICALLY SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE JESUS TOLD US TO TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE AND IF YOU DONT TAKE CARE FOR PEOPLE YOURE GONNA BURN IN HELL
MLal-t_vJPM_17	AND THE ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN COME UP WITH MAKES THIS STORY KIND OF KIND OF CREEPY BECAUSE

BvYR0L6f2Ig_24	DISPLACED THE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS OF HER CHARACTER SO WELL
X3j2zQgwYgE_7	THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS MOVIES OUT RIGHT NOW SO
Af8D0E4ZXaw_27	THE ACTING RANGES FROM MEDIOCRE TO HAM FISTED FROM THE LIVE ACTION ACTORS
vyB00TXsimI_6	SOME REALLY FUN TOUCHES WITHIN THE MOVIE IS THAT TWO VAMPIRES IN OTHER SHOWS APPEAR IN THIS MOVIE NOT AS VAMPIRES AS WELL
VCslbP0mgZI_12	SO OK IF ZACK SNYDER WERE A WOMAN I WOULD SAY OKAY SHES MAKING A COMMENT ABOUT THE WAY WOMEN CANT BE POWERED IN MALE DOMINATED SOCIETIES AND THE WAY MEN ARE DISTRACTED AND HURT AND DAMAGE WOMEN AND PREVENT THEM FROM ASSERTING WHO THEY REALLY ARE
c5xsKMxpXnc_2	I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED
Oz06ZWiO20M_11	I THINK MOST PEOPLE THATS THERE NOT ON IT IS THAT ITS NOT YOU KNOW CONVENTIONALLY SATISFYING AS LIKE YOU KNOW A DRAMA THAT WE DONT GET TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE CHARACTERS THEIR PLIGHT IS AN INTERESTING THEIR PATH TO FREEDOM IS NOT COMPELLING AND ITS BASICALLY TELESCOPE WITHIN THE FIRST 10 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WERE WERE SORT OF TOLD WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE IT HAPPENS
cM3Yna7AavY_2	IF YOU ARE BIG AFFAIRS DISNEY IS HIGHER
HEsqda8_d0Q_14	IT WAS A PHENOMENAL WEEKEND
Sqr0AcuoNnk_6	AND THIS IS THE THING FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS AND NO STRINGS ATTACHED THEY ARE THE SAME MOVIE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING TO THE SAME POINT BUT ITS THE SAME POINT

tIrG4oNLFzE_3	IVE REALLY ENJOYED A WALK TO REMEMBER ME AND THEIR JOURNEY
OtBXNcAL_lE_5	UNDERSTAND MOVIES WHERE ITS LIKE THE SAME PLOT IS LIKE 50 OTHER MILLION MOVIES
6Egk_28TtTM_11	AND I THINK I KNOW WHY I WOULD BE SCARED IS BECAUSE I WOULD FEEL SCARED AND KIND OF SAD IF I LOST MY OWN MOTHER
k5Y_838nuGo_21	I DIDNT HAVE THAT MUCH ADULT HUMOR IN IT
ZUXBRvtny7o_8	AND THE BEST THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT ALL THOSE SONGS UM WELL NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF HIS SONGS OUR NETWORKS WERE CONNECTED WITH THE SCENES
dq3Nf_lMPnE_3	DREAMWORKS IS CONFUSING ME
2WGyTLYerpo_30	AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT
QN9ZIUWUXsY_3	BUT I DO THINK ITS A VERY INTERESTING ONE

5W7Z1C_fDaE_16	THAT IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING
d6hH302o4v8_39	SEASON OF THE WITCH WAS HORRIBLE ACTING
OtBXNcAL_lE_6	[UNK]
Jkswaaud0hk_15	BUT OVERALL I THOUGHT IT WAS A FUN PICTURE I I
LSi-o-IrDMs_28	ITS IT IS A GIMMICK ULTIMATELY
W8NXH0Djyww_11	LIKE THE DUMB KIND OF COWBOYS THAT DONT KNOW WHAT THEYRE DOING ALWAYS ASKING DUMB QUESTIONS SAYING SAYING STUPID SHIT

5W7Z1C_fDaE_19	BUT WHENEVER IT COMES TO YOUR TOWN DO NOT MISS IT ITS
d6hH302o4v8_16	MOVIE IS VERY BORING
f9O3YtZ2VfI_5	THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT ITS ALL TOLD IN FLASHBACK FROM A POINT JUST BEFORE KATRINA HITS NEW ORLEANS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_9	THIS PROBABLY HAD THE UNFORTUNATE SIDE EFFECT OF RAISING FAN EXPECTATIONS TO UNREASONABLE LEVELS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_8	FORTUNATELY SOME GOOD DECISIONS WERE MADE BEFORE THE CAMERA STARTED ROLLING JOHN
9T9Hf74oK10_13	THOSE THREE ARE SOME OF THE BEST YOUNG ACTORS OF TODAY
fvVhgmXxadc_6	SHE GETS THERE IS FORCED TO NOT ONLY BE TRAPPED IN A LOCATION THAT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESNT WANT TO BE IN

cM3Yna7AavY_9	SO UH I GUESS PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SEE UH COMPUTER ANIMATED FILMS FROM NOW ON SO
pLTX3ipuDJI_1	NOTHING NEW WAS BROUGHT INTO THIS PREDATOR SERIES NO SURPRISES NO BIG TWIST NO FINISH
_dI--eQ6qVU_11	I FEEL LIKE IF THEY WOULD HAVE INSERTED THE HUMOR INTO THIS MOVIE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST TOO SERIOUS AND KIND OF BORING IN A SENSE
wMbj6ajWbic_9	THE SCRIPT IS CORNY I MEAN
PZ-lDQFboO8_9	UH MAYBE BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME DREAMWORKS BUT FOR THIS ONE FOR ME IT JUST WASNT ALL I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE
VCslbP0mgZI_14	BUT ZACK SNYDER IS A GUY AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS STUFF KIND OF ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE THE HE MAN WOMAN HATERS CLUB

8OtFthrtaJM_11	I WAS JUST WAITING FOR JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT TO COME OUT AND JUST JUMP OUT AT ANY TIME AND SAY ITS A PARADOX

9qR7uwkblbs_31	I KNEW THAT INCEPTION THAT THEY WERE GONNA BE DREAMING
cM3Yna7AavY_7	IT WAS INCREDIBLE TO SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT COLORS HOW ITS SMOOTH HAND DRAWN ANIMATION YOU KNOW
1iG0909rllw_25	MY FAVORITE SCENES IS DEFINITELY THE MILITARY UM

0h-zjBukYpk_10	BUT YOU KNOW HE DID IT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_6	THOUGH I GUESS I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT IT TURNED OUT AS GOOD AS IT DID BECAUSE
9qR7uwkblbs_25	IS A GIANT ASS TWIST TO THIS MOVIE AT THE VERY END LIKE ITS
9qR7uwkblbs_19	WE BOTH LIKE FLOGGING SHIT
cXypl4FnoZo_25	AND ANOTHER THING THE OTHER GUY WHO SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO MARRY WAS A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER LOOKING THAN PETER
Jkswaaud0hk_10	I WAS SURPRISED UH THE AMOUNT OF SKIN THEY SHOWED
I5y0__X72p0_27	SOME REALLY STRANGE CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE
1iG0909rllw_15	THE BOOK ISNT NECESSARILY THE MOST THRILLING BOOK EVER

2WGyTLYerpo_28	DANIEL CRAIG DOES A VERY GOOD JOB HERE

Sqr0AcuoNnk_8	I WAS NOT BORED DURING NO STRINGS ATTACHED
v0zCBqDeKcE_2	ALTHOUGH BROCK DID A UNIQUE MOVIE LAST TUESDAY
TvyZBvOMOTc_14	EVEN WHEN THEY ARE FIGHTING IN THE MOVIE THOUGH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ITS THEIR BAND OR NOT ACTUAL DISLIKE

0h-zjBukYpk_18	I MEAN IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO TAKE OFF THE COSTUME OR SOMETHING
9qR7uwkblbs_13	STONE WAS IN THIS MOVIE AS WELL AND HE WOULDNT REALLY KNOW IT BECAUSE SHE WAS HARDLY IN IT
8OtFthrtaJM_13	WHICH KIND OF JUST RUINS THE SUSPENSE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE THEYVE GOT SOME CONVENIENT GUY IN A FEDORA TO JUST TELL YOU OH YES WE ARE THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF RUINS THE SUSPENSE
8d-gEyoeBzc_25	PREDATOR IS REALLY WELL PACED MOVIE AND

7JsX8y1ysxY_19	AND THERES A VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_18	WAS BY FAR MY FAVORITE ACTION SCENE IN THE MOVIE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_16	UH WHEN YOU GET IN SITCOMS IN TERMS OF COMIC BOOKS AND COUNTERMOVES IT TAKES A WHILE TO DEVELOP THAT
73jzhE8R1TQ_13	THINK ABOUT IF YOU IF YOUR TOP PRIORITY IS SURVIVAL THEN WHY WOULD YOU BE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
8OtFthrtaJM_21	JUST NOT ENOUGH DEPTH BE INTERESTING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_19	I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY WELL PUT TOGETHER

Qr1Ca94K55A_7	WHATEVER SO NOW IM NOT SAYING THIS MOVIE IS BAD CAUSE ITS ITS NOT
Oz06ZWiO20M_25	THE STORY OF SWAN LAKE IS WHY PEOPLE GO SEE SOMEONE LIKE ITS THE MOVEMENT AND THE DANCING AND THE MUSIC AND THE SETS AND TO THE EXPERIENCE
9J25DZhivz8_2	THIS MOVIE IS JUST TOO ADORABLE
Nzq88NnDkEk_8	AND BEING A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL I WAS I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HIM BUT
W8NXH0Djyww_25	FOR SOME IT WAS JUST IT WAS FUN IT WAS A FUN ENTERTAINING MOVIE
Bfr499ggo-0_5	APPLICATIONS A FEW PET PEEVE TERRY WARD MUST HORRENDOUS HIDEOUS HAT THEY WERE NOT FASHIONABLE
pLTX3ipuDJI_10	BUT ITS STILL WEAK OVERALL FOR ME THEN WE WERE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO HIM AND IT WAS GONE QUICKLY
zhpQhgha_KU_21	THAT YOU REALLY CAN KIND OF SYMPATHIZE WITH I GUESS YOU HAVE KIDS

VbQk4H8hgr0_53	VERY FEW AND
PZ-lDQFboO8_11	LIGHT ENDS
yDtzw_Y-7RU_7	SO IF THATS YOUR FORM OF CHRISTIANITY ITS A CHRISTIAN FILM
W8NXH0Djyww_16	ALL THE SUNSETS AND ALL THE LANDSCAPES OF THE FILM THEY JUST LOOK SO REALISTIC IN EVERY ALMOST EVERY SCENE
I5y0__X72p0_10	I MEAN I DONT REGRET SAYING IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_2	UM UNFORTUNATELY IM GOING TO HAVE TO SAY THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE
W8NXH0Djyww_23	OH SO COOL
G6GlGvlkxAQ_24	UM BUT THEY ALSO DO A GREAT JOB OF DOING THE BACK STORY OF JANE FOSTER PLAYED BY NATALIE PORTMAN AND HER CREW AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE FLOOR
Njd1F0vZSm4_5	COME ON REALLY
73jzhE8R1TQ_1	AND THINGS I LIKED ABOUT THE MOVIE BETTER THAN I LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK AND VICE VERSA IS

VbQk4H8hgr0_15	MY LOVE FOR SOMEBODY
OtBXNcAL_lE_16	BEST FRIEND BLAH BLAH BLAH
bvLlb-M3UXU_9	THIS MOVIE ESSENTIALLY WAS MADE FOR THREE REASONS IN MY OPINION
LSi-o-IrDMs_16	ITS JUST LIKE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THEATER WITH 3D
G-xst2euQUc_10	AGAIN IT DOES REALLY TUG AT THE HEARTSTRINGS WITH THE LITTLE BABY ANIMALS IN THE BEGINNING
GWuJjcEuzt8_18	IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO SPEND GO AHEAD
7JsX8y1ysxY_11	ITS KIND OF WEIRD
I5y0__X72p0_25	ITS A GOOD ACTION MOVIE ITS LIKE
VbQk4H8hgr0_1	AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT I CAN SAY I WAS DEFINITELY DISAPPOINTED
yDtzw_Y-7RU_3	NUMBER ONE IT MEANS ITS MUCH SCARIER THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE

9T9Hf74oK10_21	I THINK IT TAKES PLACE SOMETIME UM I DONT THINK ITS A PRESENT DAY
9J25DZhivz8_17	AND SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT THERES A LOT OF CHEAP TRICKS BUT
Jkswaaud0hk_6	I THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE GOING TO ENJOY THIS MORE THAN THE GUYS ARE CERTAINLY DID
2WGyTLYerpo_41	HES GETS DEVELOPED MORE AS A MORE LIKABLE CHARACTER
7JsX8y1ysxY_27	HES A VERY GOOD JOB
BioHAh1qJAQ_3	UM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 1980S PEOPLE FIND THEIR COMPUTERS CAN DO
zhpQhgha_KU_6	I MEAN IT HAD SOME SOME GOOD MOMENTS
7JsX8y1ysxY_18	BUT SHE ACTED LIKE A POWER RANGER
Ci-AH39fi3Y_25	BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE BEST PART OF SOFT FIVE WAS THE STORYLINE LIKE IN GENERAL EVERY DAY
BioHAh1qJAQ_10	GET STRAIGHT INTO THE STORY
2WGyTLYerpo_58	A HUGE FLAW BUT ITS THERE AND IT SNOWED OVERALL
lXPQBPVc5Cw_15	IT WAS SO BAD I JUST DID NOT ENJOY IT
phBUpBr1hSo_7	UM AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE I DONT REALLY THINK THATS NECESSARILY TRUE UH I THINK THE SECOND MOVIE IN THE 3RD MOVIE ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR UM I THINK THEY TRIED TO ADD A LOT OF HEART
zhpQhgha_KU_16	I THINK THAT CHARLOTTE AND MIRANDA HAVE SOME REALLY NICE MOMENTS IN THE MOVIE
BI97DNYfe5I_28	BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD IT GETS
aiEXnCPZubE_30	THE ACTION IN THE MOVIE IS SO WELL USED
Nzq88NnDkEk_1	WHICH IS A REBOOT I GUESS WOULD BE THE BEST TERM FOR THE BLUES 1981 MOVIE CLASS OF THE TITANS
W8NXH0Djyww_5	HAD ALL THE STEREOTYPICAL TRAITS OF A WESTERN TOWN
Af8D0E4ZXaw_30	ACTING IS NOT THAT BAD BUT
IumbAb8q2dM_12	UM GETS MORE DETAILS SO I CANT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT NOW
c7UH_rxdZv4_23	KATO WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS ANY GOOD WHATSOEVER
6Egk_28TtTM_3	I LIKED GLOBAL BECAUSE HE HELPED MILO GET MILOS MOTHER AWAY FROM THE ALIENS WHICH I
f9O3YtZ2VfI_8	I DONT NEED THE ADDED ELEMENT OF KATRINA
k5Y_838nuGo_31	OH MY GOD OH MY GOD
0h-zjBukYpk_23	NOW IS SEEN IN THE BEGINNING THAT REALLY SOLD ME ON
iiK8YX8oH1E_7	MOSTLY ITS JUST KATE HUDSON BEING VERY ANNOYING
Ci-AH39fi3Y_20	BUT LUCKILY HOFFMAN STORY UH WAS IT REALLY REALLY REALLY AWESOME
Nzq88NnDkEk_5	YOU KNOW ITS GOING TO BE GOOD
vyB00TXsimI_16	THERES A SCENE IN A CAVE WHERE THEY FIGHT A GIANT MONSTER THAT REALLY REMINDS ME OF LIKE SOME SORT OF LORD OF THE RINGS MINES OF MORIA MOMENT
vyB00TXsimI_19	I THOUGHT IT WAS FUN
LSi-o-IrDMs_23	I HOPE THIS TAKES OVER AS THE NEW SYSTEM
k5Y_838nuGo_16	THE FIRST TWO WERE KIDS MOVIES
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_18	SO YEAH GO SEE IT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_10	THE THE MOVIE IS TOO LONG

cM3Yna7AavY_1	I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE MOVIE THEATERS TO GO SEE A MOVIE IVE BEEN WAITING PROBABLY ABOUT A YEAR AND A 130 YEARS FOR
bvLlb-M3UXU_7	YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DONT NEED A COMPLICATED FORMULA FOR AN ACTION MOVIE
VCslbP0mgZI_7	ACTUALLY HAS SOME SOME THEMATIC LI HAS SOME COOL THEMES ABOUT HEROISM AND ABOUT LIKE TAKING OWNERSHIP OF YOURSELF AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH I RESONATE WITH AN I WHICH WHICH I APPRECIATED
VbQk4H8hgr0_28	ITS NOT REALLY THAT GREAT EVERYONE
2iD-tVS8NPw_11	ITS NOT LIKE A DARK MOVIE OR ANYTHING
wMbj6ajWbic_11	I MEAN I DIDNT GO INTO THIS MOVIE EXPECTING TO SEE THE DARK KNIGHT
ZUXBRvtny7o_6	AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE
OtBXNcAL_lE_22	REALLY BORED WITH IT
tIrG4oNLFzE_11	GRUMPY LOOK AND THEN MAYBE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS HAPPY BUT SHE WOULDNT FROWN HER UM FROWN HER EYEBROWS THING BUT SHED STILL BE POWER TO RELAX YEAH LIKE THAT
7JsX8y1ysxY_34	UM BUT ITS EXTREMELY DARK
I5y0__X72p0_15	GOOD BYE
aiEXnCPZubE_21	AND WHICH HURTS THE FILM DRASTICALLY BECAUSE
7JsX8y1ysxY_5	PEOPLE WERE LIKE EATING POPCORN AND YOU SEE THE FIRST SHOT OF THEM ON PEOPLE YOU HEAR LIKE US THIS RIPPLE EFFECT OF WHISPERING OH MY GOD IS THAT A HE SAID AM I LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT
f9O3YtZ2VfI_14	JUST GIVE ME A NICE INTERESTING CHUNK
OtBXNcAL_lE_7	I REALLY DONT CARE TO SEE THOSE
bOL9jKpeJRs_33	[UNK]
QN9ZIUWUXsY_16	AND THEN TAKE THAT WORLD AND THEN SET LIKE A CRAP TON OF REALLY KINETIC REALLY WELL DONE ACTION SEQUENCES IN IT AND YOU HAVE TRON LEGACY
2WGyTLYerpo_4	IF YOURE EXPECTING SOME ATE SERIOUS OSCAR CONTENDER THEN YOURE WRONG
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_6	I DIDNT FIND IT ALL THAT BAD
jUzDDGyPkXU_12	THEY ALWAYS PULL OUT SOMETHING NEW AND
nbWiPyCm4g0_1	AND LET ME TELL YOU IT SURPASSED ITSELF
tmZoasNr4rU_10	MAYBE ONLY FIVE JOKES MADE ME LAUGH
MLal-t_vJPM_16	UM THERE IS NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS THING
POKffnXeBds_5	I MEAN THE MOVIE REALLY WASNT FUNNY AT ALL
zhpQhgha_KU_3	BUT THIS MOVIE KIND OF CAME OFF LIKE SOMEBODY IS REALLY SAD TRAVEL VIDEO I DONT KNOW
POKffnXeBds_6	OF ALL THE FUNNY PARTS WERE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_12	IT SEEMS LIKE THE WRITERS AND CREATORS TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT
9qR7uwkblbs_16	I DONT KNOW I GUESS WE BOTH HAVE LIKE THAT LIKE MALE SOUNDING VOICE
VCslbP0mgZI_8	BUT HERES THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEM IN THIS MOVIE WELL MAYBE THIS WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT UM THERE WAS A UH A COMEDIAN NAMED DAVE CHAPPELLE UM AND DAVE CHAPPELLE UM AND ANOTHER COMEDIAN CHRIS ROCK ARE UH AFRICAN AMERICANS AND IN THEIR COMEDY THEY SOMETIMES TAKE ON AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE AND SO THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY MAKE FUN OF BLACK PEOPLE AND THE THING WITH DAVE CHAPPELLE WITH CHRIS ROCK IS BECAUSE THEY ARE BLACK THEY CAN KIND OF DO THAT AND THERES SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THATS ACCEPTABLE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_1	AND I REALLY REALLY LOVED IT AND
rnaNMUZpvvg_3	I DIDNT EXPECT IT TO BE GOOD
2WGyTLYerpo_9	[UNK]
dq3Nf_lMPnE_15	GIVES TREK FOREVER AFTER DIRECTED BY MIKE MITCHELL A GRADE OF B MINUS
Ci-AH39fi3Y_17	THAT WAS REALLY BIZARRE AND I DIDNT CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AT ALL BECAUSE
ZUXBRvtny7o_26	I WILL EVEN PICK UP THIS MOVIE ON BLURAY UM ANYWAYS UM THE MOVIE FOR ME IS THREE STARS OUT OF FIVE STARS THREE SOLID STARS
lXPQBPVc5Cw_16	I I WILL I WILL ACTUALLY SAY THIS RIGHT NOW IT WAS A GOOD WASTE OF LIKE 12
VbQk4H8hgr0_50	IT SHOULD REALLY BE ONE
8d-gEyoeBzc_21	THE OTHER ONES ARE UNFORTUNATELY UM I THINK IN THE WRITING SOMEWHERE THEY JUST ONE UH DEVELOPED ENOUGH FOR YOU TO CARE ABOUT THEM UM AND THAT INCLUDES IS IT OH FOR GRACE I THINK THATS HIS NAME INCLUDES HIS CHARACTER UM
cM3Yna7AavY_14	AND I HATE IT HOME ON THE RANGE
c7UH_rxdZv4_9	AND UNLIKE OTHER FILMS WERE THEYRE KIND OF A NARCISSISTIC FRAT BOY BUT THEY BRING SOMETHING TO THE TABLE YOU KNOW THAT
Oz06ZWiO20M_3	I DONT THINK ITS LIKE THE WORST MOVIE IVE EVEN SEEN JUST THIS YEAR
2WGyTLYerpo_15	CHILLS
d6hH302o4v8_30	AND WAS AWFUL
c7UH_rxdZv4_30	AND KIND OF INTERESTING
vyB00TXsimI_13	SHE IS A REALLY PRETTY GIRL
aiEXnCPZubE_24	THE ACTING COULD BE BETTER IN HIS VERY MEDIOCRE
Qr1Ca94K55A_9	IT WAS GOOD
c7UH_rxdZv4_26	NOTHING THATS WORTH GOING TO THEATERS TO SEE
IumbAb8q2dM_22	SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU GUYS ALL THE MORE SMOKING
etzxEpPuc6I_10	THE PLOT IS RIDICULOUS BUT NO ONE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY LIKE
bOL9jKpeJRs_14	[UNK]
MLal-t_vJPM_15	SECOND THERE IS ONE MASSIVE PLOT HOLE IN THIS FILM AND IT IS THE SIZE OF A DRAGON ITS AS BIG AS A MOUNTAIN AND WHEN YOU SEE THE FILM YOU WILL PROBABLY KNOW WHAT I MEAN
ZUXBRvtny7o_10	IS THAT THE STUDY IS A GOOD THING
jUzDDGyPkXU_23	BUT HE TOTALLY SELLS IT
IumbAb8q2dM_4	UM I SUGGEST THAT YOU GUYS GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE
_dI--eQ6qVU_7	AND MOST OF YOU KNOW HES A PRETTY FUNNY GUY
Nzq88NnDkEk_6	BUT AS THE TRAILERS CAME OUT I I REALLY LIKED WHAT I WAS SEEING

2WGyTLYerpo_47	SHE IS EVERYTHING
pLTX3ipuDJI_5	YOU DONT SEE ANY OF THEIR PERSONALITIES WHEN ONE DIES NO MORE OF THEM AND YOU DONT GET AN ATTACHMENT TO ANYBODY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_43	LIKE I SAID I LOVED THE HOFF MAIN STORYLINE SO
tIrG4oNLFzE_1	NOW I AM HUGE HUGE FAN OF NICHOLAS SPARKS UM
d6hH302o4v8_2	NICOLAS CAGE SHOULD NOT DO THIS KIND OF MOVIES
wMbj6ajWbic_8	YOU KNOW UH CORNY BUT
Iu2PFX3z_1s_2	AND HE WHAT HE DOES WITH HANNAH IS HE MAKES A MOVIE UNLIKE ANYTHING WEVE SEEN BEFORE
I5y0__X72p0_14	ITS IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE A SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL TYPE OF MOVIE IT IS
zhpQhgha_KU_11	I JUST PERSONALLY I JUST DIDNT REALLY ENJOY IT
LSi-o-IrDMs_17	UM BUT UH THEY LOOKED AWESOME
tIrG4oNLFzE_5	SO I WENT INTO THE STORE HAD QUITE HIGH EXPECTATIONS

ob23OKe5a9Q_7	[UNK]
HEsqda8_d0Q_22	I DOUBT THAT THEYRE GOING TO DO THIS FOR ALL OF THE SCREENINGS BECAUSE IT IS THE PREMIER
2iD-tVS8NPw_4	ITS A HUGE SORT OF SPECTACLE MOVIE THAT IS GREAT FOR THE SUMMERTIME YOU KNOW THIS
G-xst2euQUc_12	SO WHAT ITS STILL A REALLY GREAT MOVIE TO TAKE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO

cW1FSBF59ik_12	AFTER THE BUS ALL THOSE CAPS IN THE AIR AND LANDS AND ALL THE DEAD BODIES FALLEN FUCKING SICK
HEsqda8_d0Q_7	THE END PART IS REALLY REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_17	NOT IN ALL INSTANCES BUT THE ONES THAT MATTER THE MOST YEAH
VCslbP0mgZI_13	I COULD KIND OF SEE THAT IN A SORT OF CHRIS ROCK DAVE CHAPPELLE WAY
9c67fiY0wGQ_9	IT IS A FUN FAMILY FILM
03bSnISJMiM_3	I MEAN WE DID A LITTLE BIT OF IT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_23	ESPECIALLY WHEN HES HANGING OUT WITH A MARRIED MAN WHO ALL BUT ONE OF THEM ARE PROBABLY EARLY TWENTIES AND ONE WAS MAYBE MID TWENTIES AND MEANWHILE YOURE HANGING OUT WITH PAPA RUSSELL IT JUST LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU GUYS HANG OUT AND SOMEONE BROUGHT THEIR DAD ALONG BECAUSE HE OFFERED
Ci-AH39fi3Y_42	IT WAS PRETTY MUCH JUST AN EXCUSE TO PUT TRAPS IN THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT
iiK8YX8oH1E_8	I THINK ITS PREDICTABLE UP TO A POINT
bOL9jKpeJRs_34	I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LOVE IT
fvVhgmXxadc_14	ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY THE BEST COMPARISON IS THAT THIS FILM ACTUALLY WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE PANS LABYRINTH
7JsX8y1ysxY_35	I WARN YOU ITS VERY VERY DARK
d6hH302o4v8_19	I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I SAW THIS MOVIE UH
ob23OKe5a9Q_8	[UNK]

iiK8YX8oH1E_1	ONE OF THOSE ROMANTIC COMEDIES THAT WE ALL DREAD
zhpQhgha_KU_32	UM YEAH I MEAN IF YOU WANNA SEE A VIDEO UM SOMEBODY WHO ENJOYED THE FILM
BI97DNYfe5I_6	TO ME THATS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE
cXypl4FnoZo_22	LIKE WE WANTED IT TO BE THAT SHE KNEW UM AMANDA SEYFRIED CHARACTER KNEW IT WAS PETER WHO WAS PRETENDING SHE DIDNT SO THAT SHE HAD A REASON TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM AND THEY COULD BE TOGETHER THATS

wMbj6ajWbic_18	YOU KNOW THEYRE IN THERE THIS IS A CHEESY MOVIE
5W7Z1C_fDaE_2	SEVEN UM THATS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS FILM ITS BIG
Iu2PFX3z_1s_7	THERES ALL THESE COLORFUL CHARACTERS
QN9ZIUWUXsY_10	ITS A BIT OF A MIXED BAG BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME VERY BRIGHT MOMENTS
yDtzw_Y-7RU_5	LET ME SAY THIS IF YOUR CHRISTIANITY IS EXTREMELY LEGALISTIC THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU
Ci-AH39fi3Y_13	AND THE IRRELEVANT PLOT WAS WITH FIVE RANDOM STRANGERS KIND OF LIKE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_38	AND IT FITS VERY WELL INTO THE SAW SERIES IN MY OPINION SO
d6hH302o4v8_26	ACTION SCENES WERE VERY DUMB
cW1FSBF59ik_8	I LOVE THE NAME WADE
HEsqda8_d0Q_31	I CAN IMAGINE GETTING THIS ON DVD AND WATCHING IT AT CHRISTMAS TIME BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL SO LIKE ITS NOT ABOUT COMMERCIALIZATION ITS ABOUT YOU KNOW FAMILIES BEING TOGETHER
rnaNMUZpvvg_19	KILLING THESE PEOPLE YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHATS GOING ON LIKE DUDE GET OVER YOURSELF

Ci-AH39fi3Y_41	I DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE THINKING
nbWiPyCm4g0_2	REACH NEW HEIGHTS OF HORRENDOUS
8OtFthrtaJM_6	FIRST OFF THE COMMERCIAL MAKES THE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MISTAKE OF SAYING THAT IT IS MORE THOUGHT PROVOKING THAN INCEPTION
1DmNV9C1hbY_1	FOR THIS ONE I JUST DIDNT FEEL LIKE IT
5W7Z1C_fDaE_13	ITS SO WELL DONE FOR
pLTX3ipuDJI_15	IT DOESNT GIVE ME GIVE ANY INSIGHT OR HELP IT JUST MAKES THEM SEEM LIKE SHE SAW THE FIRST MOVIE
WKA5OygbEKI_13	SO IT HAS SOME REALLY GOOD REFERENCES OF PAST JOHNNY DEPP FILMS IN IT LIKE WHILE THE CHAMELEON IS GETTING BOUNCED ALONG THE HIGHWAY RUN INTO HUNDREDS THOMPSON
pLTX3ipuDJI_4	IN THE FIRST ONE THEY ARE A TEAM AND THEY WORK TOGETHER AND YOU SEE THEIR PERSONALITIES THIS MOVIE JUST POPS THE GROUP OF DIFFERENT KILLERS DOWN TOGETHER AND LET THEM INTERACT POORLY
OQvJTdtJ2H4_5	[UNK]
2iD-tVS8NPw_22	THIS IS A PLAYGROUND AND AN IMAGINARY PLAYGROUND AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AND I THINK THATS WHAT ALSO MADE THE FILM EXCITING GAME

jUzDDGyPkXU_6	IN FACT THIS MOVIE ISNT EVEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DISTRICT NINE NOR IS IT UH FOR UH BLACK HAWK DOWN WHICH PEOPLE ARE COMPARED TO
ob23OKe5a9Q_3	[UNK]
fvVhgmXxadc_12	WHATS IN YOUR MIND WITHIN HER MIND IN A WAY ITS KIND OF LIKE INCEPTION IN THAT WAY
yDtzw_Y-7RU_12	OR IT JUST REALLY DOESNT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO US TODAY AT ALL
Bfr499ggo-0_15	BUT ALSO NOT NECESSARY
dq3Nf_lMPnE_13	IF IT WERENT FOR THE GREAT CHARACTERS OF SHREK AND HIS SUPPORTING CAST THEY ARE STILL VOICED BY THE ORIGINAL STARS MIKE MEYERS EDDIE MURPHY CAMERON DIAZ AND ANTONIO BOUND ERIS THE FILM WOULD BE A REAL BUST
iiK8YX8oH1E_6	THERE ARE SOME FUNNY MOMENTS BUT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_21	HES NOT GOING TO BE LOOKING LIKE A CHIP A BRIGHT YOUNG MAN BUT EARLY THIRTIES REALLY YOU WANT ME TO BUY THAT
03bSnISJMiM_4	BUT NOT A WHOLE LUNCH AND THEY SHOULD HAVE

phBUpBr1hSo_4	UM I DONT THINK THAT THIS ONE GOT AS MUCH BUZZ AND AS MUCH UM MEDIA ATTENTION AND WORD OF MOUTH YOU KNOW SPREADING AROUND AND STUFF
aiEXnCPZubE_13	IT DOESNT HAVE ANY PRESENCE OF GREATNESS AT ALL
tStelxIAHjw_7	I LIKE WALLY

Clx4VXItLTE_8	INSIDIOUS UM START REALLY GOOD
2WGyTLYerpo_51	SUCH AS SOMETIMES THE ALIENS IN THE WESTERN SETTING DO LOOK A LITTLE GOOFY
c7UH_rxdZv4_31	HAVING THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT SHOWS GENUINE CARE FOR OTHER PEOPLE BE THE VILLAIN UM
iiK8YX8oH1E_3	YELLS AND SCREAMS THE WHOLE MOVIE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_21	AND ITS SO SO SHORT LIVED HEE BARELY NEEDS TO EVEN BE THERE
TvyZBvOMOTc_3	THE COUNTRYSIDE WHICH THEY SHOWED WHILE GOING ACROSS IRELAND WAS ASTOUNDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
X3j2zQgwYgE_5	BUT ITS REALLY NOT WONDERFUL NOTHING
vyB00TXsimI_4	SHE ALSO HAS PRETTY SWEET MOVES
VbQk4H8hgr0_45	AND NOT AT ALL ORIGINAL IN MY OPINION
Bfr499ggo-0_9	UM BUT YOU KNOW THE PREMISES OKAY IN
ZUXBRvtny7o_30	DO YOU THINK IS ITS NORMAL ITS NOT BAD ITS NOT BAD AT ALL
d3_k5Xpfmik_14	IT USES AND THIS JUST DOESNT APPLY TO THE UH UH CREDITS SEQUENCE ON ITS OWN BUT APPLIES TO THE MOVIE AS A WHOLE IT REALLY KNOWS HOW TO USE SLOW MOTION WITHOUT MAKING IT A GIMMICK
yDtzw_Y-7RU_11	THEREFORE A LOT OF THE SOCIAL COMMENTARY GOES WHIP OVER YOUR HEAD
k5Y_838nuGo_25	QUOTE IN THIS MOVIE THAT SOUNDS SO DIRTY COMING OUT
Njd1F0vZSm4_8	IN FACT MY SIX YEAR OLD WAS SCARED MOST OF THE MOVIE
_dI--eQ6qVU_12	BUT THE HUMOR REALLY JUST NAILED IT
8d-gEyoeBzc_28	THAT THEY MEET UH WITH UH LARGE FISH BANDS CHARACTER IT DOES SLOW DOWN A GREAT DEAL
W8NXH0Djyww_12	AND IT WAS JUST OH IT WAS HYSTERICAL
nzpVDcQ0ywM_11	ALL I CAN SAY IS HES A PRETTY AVERAGE GUY
zhpQhgha_KU_22	I MEAN EVEN IF YOU DONT HAVE KIDS BECAUSE
7JsX8y1ysxY_32	SO OVERALL ITS ITS LIKE A BLEND OF YOU GOT AN ALTERNATIVE HISTORY
73jzhE8R1TQ_10	AND THE NUMBERS THEY AND THEY ARE KIND OF STUCK TO THE BOOK OF IT SO SO I LIKE THAT AND UM
2iD-tVS8NPw_13	SO ITS PERFECT FOR KIDS AS WELL AS JUST LIKE TEENAGERS AS WELL WHO JUST WANT TO SEE A LOT OF EXPLOSIONS AND SOME CRAZY STUFF AND
VbQk4H8hgr0_7	AND OFFERED NOTHING OF SUCH IT WASNT
tStelxIAHjw_11	I JUST HATED IT
8qrpnFRGt2A_16	FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING ONE OF THOSE ARMY OF ONE COMMERCIAL SOMETIMES
2iD-tVS8NPw_24	BUT THEN YOU KIND OF LIKE WALK OUT OF THE MOVIE YOURE LIKE WELL I I GET WHAT HAPPENED I UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED BUT
BI97DNYfe5I_30	UM FUN AT THE END
nzpVDcQ0ywM_10	THEY ARENT PLAYING TO YOU THEYRE PLAYING TO A NEW AUDIENCE OF KIDS WHO DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE CHARACTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE
BioHAh1qJAQ_6	UNFORTUNATELY UM THE WRITERS AND I WERE NOT EXACTLY ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH
cXypl4FnoZo_20	UM AH I WISH WE WISH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UM THE GUY
bOL9jKpeJRs_32	[UNK]
f9O3YtZ2VfI_20	BUT DONT GET ME WRONG ITS NOT ALL BAD
0h-zjBukYpk_21	ACTUALLY LIKE THEM A LOT
_dI--eQ6qVU_17	BUT WHEN THEY FIGURE OUT A NEW WAY TO INTERPRET THIS
9T9Hf74oK10_8	A LOT OF CRITICS SAID THAT IT RELIED TOO MUCH ON THE AUDIENCE TO UH EXPLORE THE THEMES IN THE FILM AND YOU KNOW RIGHTLY SO I GUESS ITS
03bSnISJMiM_12	BUT IT WAS REALLY GOOD
2iD-tVS8NPw_19	AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO GO THAT ROUTE BUT
I5y0__X72p0_5	THEY BOTH LIKED IT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_11	THE FINAL PRODUCT ULTIMATELY DOESNT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE OR TO THAT FIRST TRAILER BUT
phBUpBr1hSo_8	AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE TOO MUCH TOO FAST I MEAN THEYRE ALREADY TELLING EACH OTHER THEY LOVE EACH OTHER AND TALKING ABOUT GETTING WEDDING RINGS AND SPENDING THE REST OF THEIR LIFE TOGETHER THEY LIVE TOGETHER I MEAN ITS JUST WAY TOO MUCH TOO FAST THEY TRY TO PUT HEART INTO IT BY YOU KNOW HIM SAYING YOU KNOW YOURE THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IN THIS WORLD YOU KNOW I DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF YOU KNOW BECAUSE SHE THINKS HES DOING CRAZY STUFF SACRIFICING HIS LIFE AND THEN HE DOES CRAZY STUFF TO SAVE HER AND HES LIKE I LOVE YOU AND YOU KNOW JUST ALL THE SAPPY BLA BLA BLA SUBMISSION
aiEXnCPZubE_2	THERE IS NEVER A FEELING OF STAR QUALITY WITH HER
1iG0909rllw_28	AND I THINK THE MILITARY THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING BIT OF THE ENTIRE FILM
7JsX8y1ysxY_33	ITS VERY VERY INTERESTING
1iG0909rllw_23	SOME OF THE MOMENTS AND THIS IS JUST THE WHOLE THING WAS LAUGHING
GWuJjcEuzt8_6	AND HER FACE DOESNT MOVE AT ALL
jUzDDGyPkXU_10	DESIGN THE ALIENS IN A REALLY COOL UNIQUE WAY TO MAKE THEM LIKE BIOTIC BUT ALSO MECHANICAL
vvZ4IcEtiZc_6	OF THE GREAT PERFORMANCES UM OF LAST YEAR WERE KIND OF OVERLOOKED BECAUSE THERES JUST SO MANY OF THEM
_dI--eQ6qVU_5	AND I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IT WAS HILARIOUS
9T9Hf74oK10_18	SO LOOK OUT FOR THAT THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING
d6hH302o4v8_23	AND THIS IS THE WORST BY FAR
I5y0__X72p0_32	I DONT LIKE THIS
G6GlGvlkxAQ_6	A GREAT EIGHTIES MOVIE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVENT SEEN IT
zhpQhgha_KU_30	BECAUSE IT REALLY WASNT ALL THAT MUCH TO IT FOR ME
Ci-AH39fi3Y_2	AS SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS BUT I WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT SO FIVE OKAY ALL
BvYR0L6f2Ig_25	YOU ACTUALLY FEEL FOR HER CHARACTER
d3_k5Xpfmik_6	IT CONTAINS UM REALLY REALLY WELL DONE AND FAITHFUL MARRIAGE IS TO BE A ZOMBIE HORROR SUB GENRE AND
OtBXNcAL_lE_11	AND DONT GET ME WRONG THEY WERE YOU KNOW FUNNY PARTS IN THE MOVIE
2WGyTLYerpo_10	AND ITS SATISFACTORY
Oz06ZWiO20M_16	A REMAINDER IN NARRATIVE FILM IS ABOUT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND PLOT AND THEN SPECTACLE LIKE IN 3RD PLACE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_5	BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF GREAT MOVIES OUT THIS YEAR SO
vyB00TXsimI_10	YEAH THATS ABOUT HOW MY FAVORITES LIST GOES
2WGyTLYerpo_61	IT WAS REALLY FUNNY
aiEXnCPZubE_3	SHE ISNT TERRIBLE BUT
73jzhE8R1TQ_17	UM LIKE I SAID IT WASNT BIG DEAL
G-xst2euQUc_17	BUT THERE REALLY HASNT BEEN MUCH THAT HAS COME OUT THIS YEAR SO FAR THAT IVE BEEN DYING TO GO SEE
VbQk4H8hgr0_35	BUT THEY DIDNT EVEN GIVE HIM THAT MUCH TO DO THAT HE HAD ONLY A FEW MINOR LINES
Af8D0E4ZXaw_3	AND PUT THEM IN A JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIE WITH A RITUAL BATMAN AND SUPERMAN
phBUpBr1hSo_1	I WANTED THIS MOVIE VERY VERY EXCITED
ob23OKe5a9Q_10	[UNK]

W8NXH0Djyww_7	IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE
wMbj6ajWbic_13	IVE SEEN OVER THE SUMMER I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MADE IT THE BEST ACTION MOVIE I SAW IN SOME OF THIS
dq3Nf_lMPnE_11	IN THEIR PLACE IS A RUN OF THE MILL ANIMATED ACTION ADVENTURE PLOT WITH A FEW CHUCKLES THROWN IN
2WGyTLYerpo_5	THE ONLY OSCAR I COULD EVEN THINK OF IS MAYBE LIKE BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY
jUzDDGyPkXU_1	THE ACTION IS FUCKING AWESOME
BioHAh1qJAQ_22	THE WRITERS JUST PULLED THIS OUT OF THEIR ASS
atnd_PF-Lbs_1	ITS BAN
HEsqda8_d0Q_19	BUT THEN ITS SO OBVIOUSLY NOT AN ENGLISH CHARACTER
IumbAb8q2dM_17	EXCITED
2WGyTLYerpo_25	REALLY ENJOYED THAT

GWuJjcEuzt8_11	SEXY BUT NOT SLEEPY YOU KNOW
c7UH_rxdZv4_21	HI IM PRETTY I HAVE A GIANT SMILE IM SUPPOSED TO KNOW THINGS AND WALK OFF SCREEN
VbQk4H8hgr0_5	I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THAT
fvVhgmXxadc_7	NOW IT ALSO TAKES A REALLY CREEPY AND WE CONSIDER THE FACT THAT EMILY BROWNING IN THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE SHES UNDERAGE
GWuJjcEuzt8_12	WITH DROP DEAD GORGEOUS BY THE WAY BUT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_16	AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST LIKE REALLY NATURAL AND FUNNY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_27	IT WAS NOT A HUGE SWORD TWIST MOMENT
Jkswaaud0hk_9	GREAT STEAMY BEDROOM SCENES
9J25DZhivz8_16	THERE IS ONE SCENE IN THIS MOVIE THAT MAKES 3D ENTIRELY WORTH IT
73jzhE8R1TQ_5	BUT UM I WAS IN CRAZY ABOUT IT
nbWiPyCm4g0_8	LET ME SEE IF I CAN RUSTLE UP SOME SYMPATHY YEAH I GOT NOTHING
_dI--eQ6qVU_19	MAKES IT MORE VISUALLY APPEALING AND
tStelxIAHjw_2	UM I THINK THE LAST MOVIE I SAW IN THEATERS WAS TOY STORY THREE AND I HATED IT
c7UH_rxdZv4_5	BASICALLY SETH ROGAN BROUGHT NONE OF THE CHARM THAT HE NORMALLY DOES TO HIS ROLES
I5y0__X72p0_26	90 BOURNE IDENTITY MEETS 10 WILLIE WALKER THERE SO
9qR7uwkblbs_26	OBVIOUSLY NOT LIKE A SERIOUS FUCKING MOVIE OR ANYTHING
k5Y_838nuGo_11	UM I I DID ENJOY IT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_16	ANYWAY THE 3RD ONE ACTING WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE SECOND ONE ANYWAY
Nzq88NnDkEk_17	UH THE SCREENING I WAS AT I I KINDA FOUND MYSELF YOU KNOW WANTING TO LAY MY HEAD BACK AND TAKE A NAP
8qrpnFRGt2A_4	AND UM I UH PRETTY MUCH PRETTY MUCH MET MY LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MOST PART
BI97DNYfe5I_8	YOU KNOW THATS OKAY I GUESS
tIrG4oNLFzE_13	LIKE THOSE THOSE THOSE MOMENTS IN THE FILM ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING WHERE SHE WOULD SIT THERE STAND ACROSS WITH HER ARMS CROSSED AND JUST LOOK OUT INTO THE DISTANCE LIKE OR SHOULD LOOK TO THE BEACH OR SHOULD LOOK AT HER DAD OR SHOULD LOOK AT HER BROTHER WITH YOU THINK AND I I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE CHARACTERS DOING LIKE
aiEXnCPZubE_29	AND JUST OVERALL SUPERB
9qR7uwkblbs_29	LIKE WHAT THE  LIKE THATS WHAT IM GOOD AT LIKE
HEsqda8_d0Q_12	EXPECTING THAT MUCH BECAUSE
LSi-o-IrDMs_20	SOMETIMES 3D CAN MESS UP THE COLOUR AT LEAST THE OLD ANAGLYPHIC 3D I THINK REAL D IT YOU KNOW IT HAD SORT OF A SORT OF TEMPTED MULLINS IS SO ITS ALSO UM NOT IDEAL FOR FOR THE IMAGE ITSELF
ob23OKe5a9Q_13	[UNK]
Ci-AH39fi3Y_37	BUT LIKE I SAID THE UH PLOT OF HOFFMAN EVERYTHING THAT WAS REALLY REALLY AWESOME
9qR7uwkblbs_22	LIKE SHES MY SPIRIT ANIMAL AND THEN SHE WASNT
phBUpBr1hSo_19	A PRETTY GOOD SCRIPT
OQvJTdtJ2H4_15	UM MEDUSA WAS WAY DIFFERENT LAND OF LAWSUITS
BvYR0L6f2Ig_23	FOR ME THIS WEDNESDAY MUST SAY SHE IS A TERRIFIC AND BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED ACTRESS SHE IS DISPLACED
wMbj6ajWbic_27	UM JAMMER CHRISTOPHER ALLISON
cXypl4FnoZo_16	I DONT KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU WHO HE IS ABOUT YOU BEING LIKE THAT DOESNT NARROW IT DOWN AT ALL
6Egk_28TtTM_10	I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I THOUGHT IT WAS RELEASED KIND OF SCARY
_dI--eQ6qVU_23	THE GREEN HORNET DID SOMETHING SIMILAR
TvyZBvOMOTc_13	SEEM TO BE REALLY ENJOYING THEMSELVES THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH
tIrG4oNLFzE_7	BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I WAS REALLY UM WHERE YOU GOING LIKE
2iD-tVS8NPw_21	AND I THINK HAVING THAT SORT OF SUPERPOWER ALMOST THIS POWER TO JUST IMAGINE ANYTHING KIND OF JUST UH HELP ME GET PAST THAT MANY OF THESE ARE ALL C GI CHARACTERS IS THAT
Oz06ZWiO20M_14	I KNOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND SILLY BECAUSE ITS SUCH A BROAD GOOFY MAINSTREAM CULT KIND OF MOVIE BUT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_2	I BELIEVE THAT A SUCCESSFUL GREEN LANTERN MOVIE WOULD LEAVE WARNER BROTHERS TO ADAPT THE FLASH AND WONDER WOMAN AMONG POSSIBLY OTHERS
BioHAh1qJAQ_24	CALLED IS OS AND SUICIDE OR WHY DO WE NEED THESE THINGS
tmZoasNr4rU_17	THE ACTION FEELS THAT ITS UM IT ITS ITS PRETTY MUCH JUST UH QUICK CUT OR SLASH BLOOD SCREEN YOU KNOW FLASH
bvLlb-M3UXU_2	ITS NOT A COMPELLING NARRATIVE BY ANY MEANS THERES
1iG0909rllw_17	THE BEST THE MOST THRILLING READ EVER I HAVE TO SAY THAT SO OVERALL

1DmNV9C1hbY_9	UM IM SURE KIDS ARE GONNA LOVE IT
6Egk_28TtTM_7	BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD MOVIE
1iG0909rllw_20	THE SCRIPT IT LEFT ALL THE KEY PLOTS AND THE EMOTION FROM THE CHARACTERS TO BE EXPOSED THROUGH DIALOGUE
BioHAh1qJAQ_11	YOU HAVE A LOT OF UH REFERENCES TO THE FIRST MOVIE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_16	THIS ALSO FALLS INTO THE TREND IS VERY POPULAR THESE DAYS YOU DO A WHOLE LOT OF C GI
nzpVDcQ0ywM_23	FIGHT SEQUENCES ARE PRETTY NEAT

VbQk4H8hgr0_55	YEAH I JUST
cM3Yna7AavY_4	NOW I HAD SOME HIKES MAYBE NOT HIGH EXPECTATIONS PER SE BUT I WAS DEFINITELY EXPECTING THIS TO BE A GOOD MOVIE
LSi-o-IrDMs_18	THE 3D ITSELF REALLY HAS IMPROVED
W8NXH0Djyww_2	ME UP
f9O3YtZ2VfI_2	ITS A VERY INTERESTING IDEA AND
1DmNV9C1hbY_7	AND WHILE THE TRAILER MADE THE FILM LOOK REAL NICE AND CUTE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_24	BUT ITS ITS LIKE SOMEONE MADE YOU A KICK ASS SANDWICH BUT THEY PUT MAYONNAISE ON IT AND YOU DONT LIKE MAYONNAISE AND ITS NOT LIKE TOMATO OR LETTUCE WHERE YOU CAN PICK IT OFF NO ITS GOT ITS MANNERS AND ITS ALL OVER EVERYTHING AND NOW YOURE STUCK WITH THIS KICK ASS SANDWICH THAT WOULD BE KICK ASS IF IT DIDNT HAVE MANNERS ON IT BUT THIS MAN IS ON IT OR YOU GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH

1DmNV9C1hbY_5	BUT YOU KNOW FOR THIS ONE I JUST DIDNT CARE
TvyZBvOMOTc_15	ALL IN ALL IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A CUTE ROMANTIC COMEDY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SETTING THEN THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD MOVIE FOR YOU

Ci-AH39fi3Y_36	DIDNT EVEN YOU KNOW TRY TO CLOSE IT AT ALL LIKE THE WIND ISNT GOING TO BLOW IT UP OR ANYTHING ITS JUST OPEN
_dI--eQ6qVU_22	AND I JUST REALLY ENJOYED IT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_4	IN SOME WAYS THE FIRST ONE WAS BETTER
Qr1Ca94K55A_6	IT MADE IT HYSTERICAL AND IT WAS JUST FUNNY WITH ALL OF HIS LITTLE ONE LINERS THAT HE HAD
k5Y_838nuGo_27	DO NOT WATCH THE WHOLE AM I THE ONLY ONE AM I PERVERT ENOUGH TO THINK THAT SOUNDS DIRTY BECAUSE IT TOTALLY DOES WAFFLE HOLE
7JsX8y1ysxY_7	UM THERE COULD HAVE BEEN LESS LOONY BECAUSE
jUzDDGyPkXU_14	BUT THEY GIVE YOU A GOOD AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEM
Jkswaaud0hk_8	THERE ARE SOME FUNNY LINES
Ci-AH39fi3Y_35	MAN OH MAN IT REALLY LEFT THE DOOR OPEN
Nzq88NnDkEk_21	IM GONNA SAY THIS ONE IS PROBABLY GONNA BE WAIT UNTIL IT COMES OUT ON HBO OR
Af8D0E4ZXaw_13	DO A GREAT JOB WITH THEIR ROLES
bOL9jKpeJRs_25	[UNK]
rnaNMUZpvvg_6	COULD BARELY STAY AWAKE THROUGH THE MOVIE
2WGyTLYerpo_29	KIND OF CHANNELS A MAN WITH NO NAME CLINT EASTWOOD
Iu2PFX3z_1s_1	THIS IS HIS MOST ENGAGING ENDEAVOR YET ITS
G-xst2euQUc_11	UM IT HAS IT HAS A VERY PREDICTABLE STORY BUT
etzxEpPuc6I_11	LIKE EVEN THE ACTORS WERE JUST LIKE YOU KNOW ITS A MOVIE ABOUT A FUCKING TOY
1iG0909rllw_1	I THOUGHT THEY WERE AVERAGE
d6hH302o4v8_15	VERY BORING AS WELL
iiK8YX8oH1E_11	SO I WILL GIVE IT POINTS FOR NOT BEING EXACTLY LIKE MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING EVEN THOUGH THE TRAILER SET IT UP THAT WAY
VbQk4H8hgr0_14	ITS NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES
cXypl4FnoZo_24	AND WE KIND OF WANTED IT TO BE LIKE THAT EXCEPT NOT AS OBVIOUS BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD RIGHT LIKE CAUSE THEN IT WOULD GIVE THEM A REASON BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO GET MARRIED BUT THEY COULDNT BECAUSE SHE WAS GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GUY
jUzDDGyPkXU_17	THE DIALOGUE IS TERRIBLE
atnd_PF-Lbs_13	THE VIOLENCE HERE IS PRETTY BAD
vvZ4IcEtiZc_3	AND I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT UM HOW ITS THE PERFORMANCES IN IT WERE SORT OF OVERLOOKED AT THE ACADEMY AWARDS BECAUSE OF
7JsX8y1ysxY_4	SO ITS PRETTY FUNNY ITS
wMbj6ajWbic_25	THE GUY FROM LOST HAD A LOT OF FUNDING
bOL9jKpeJRs_11	[UNK]
BvYR0L6f2Ig_5	SO IT WAS JUST ABOUT EQUAL TO THE FIRST ONE
8OtFthrtaJM_15	INTERESTINGLY IT TURNED OUT TO BE MORE OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY THAN IT WAS A THRILLER
Clx4VXItLTE_20	AND I WOULD GO TO THE CINEMA AGAIN TO SEE IT BECAUSE
Njd1F0vZSm4_9	ARE MY OTHER COMPLAINTS OTHER THAN THAT THERES LIKE NOTHING LIGHT OR FUNNY IN THE STORY TO BREAK UP THE SUMMER MOOD IS THE BATTLE ITSELF
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_3	SO I REALLY WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THIS MOVIE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_7	OH MY GOD THE WHOLE MOVIE HAD A REALLY DRY DIALOGUE
8d-gEyoeBzc_23	I THINK RODRIGUEZ WHEN HE WROTE THE ROAD THE MOVIE WAS GOING FOR A MARLON BRANDO APOCALYPSE NOW TYPE OF CHARACTER BY
GWuJjcEuzt8_15	AND OVERALL PROBABLY ID GIVE IT ABOUT 35 STARS YOU KNOW POPCORN MOVIE AND YOU KNOW CAUSE YOU
7JsX8y1ysxY_3	SO REALLY SUCK AT ACTING
bvLlb-M3UXU_5	REALLY THERE IS NO HUMOROUS TALES THESE GUYS JUST
lXPQBPVc5Cw_1	YES WHEN YOU HEAR JOHNNY JEFF YOU THINK THIS MOVIE HAS TO BE GOOD
c7UH_rxdZv4_8	HE UM HAD ALL THE CHARM OF A NARCISSISTIC FRAT BOY THE WHOLE FILM
tmZoasNr4rU_3	I COULDNT GET INTO IT
03bSnISJMiM_9	OH MY GOD
Bfr499ggo-0_12	THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST CUT THE WEDDING AT THE BEGINNING
VbQk4H8hgr0_8	REMOTELY FUNNY
8OtFthrtaJM_12	NOW THE ONLY SUSPENSEFUL PART THAT I FOUND IN THE FIRST 30 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MATT DAMON FIRST DISCOVERED THE BUREAU IN THE FIRST PLACE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_1	THE MAIN DRAW FOR ME FOR THIS MOVIE WAS JUST THE FACT THAT ITS SET IN THIS LIKE RIDICULOUS WORLD WITH ALL THESE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND RIDICULOUS ACTION SEQUENCES
IumbAb8q2dM_1	I ALWAYS LIKE TO READ THE BOOK FIRST
8OtFthrtaJM_14	NO IM NOT IM NOT EXCITED ANYMORE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_2	UH IM A CAT GUY CAPTAIN AMERICA FAN
IumbAb8q2dM_21	I
iiK8YX8oH1E_15	IF THERE IS ANY SILVER LINING IN THIS MOVIE ITS JOHN KRASINSKI
G-xst2euQUc_21	RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE
tmZoasNr4rU_5	MAYBE PLANET TERROR IM IM NOT SURE IM JUST
2WGyTLYerpo_33	ITS REALLY REALLY HARD CORE
PZ-lDQFboO8_3	IT DIDNT HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF HUMOR GOING ON WITH IT AT LEAST NONE THAT REALLY MADE YOU WANT TO LAUGH OUT LOUD
lXPQBPVc5Cw_29	THE ADULTS WERE THE ADULTS WERE ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO WATCH IT AND PEOPLE WHO ARE MY AGE AS WELL WERE LIKE WHAT DID I JUST C
lXPQBPVc5Cw_28	UM IN GENERAL UM THE LITTLE KIDS SEEMED TO LIKE IT THAT WERE IN THERE BUT
d6hH302o4v8_21	BUT WHEN I SAW IT WAS THIS TOTALLY BORING
HEsqda8_d0Q_5	I THOUGHT HOW THE HELL IS DICKENS AND DISNEY CAN WORK TOGETHER LIKE THIS SO
VbQk4H8hgr0_21	DISAPPOINTED ME HIGHLY AND
c7UH_rxdZv4_3	I WISH IT WERE BECAUSE I
k5Y_838nuGo_20	THE 3RD ONE WAS MORE KID HUMOR THOUGH
BXuRRbG0Ugk_27	THEYRE ALL PLAYING CLICHED STOCK WESTERN CHARACTERS
Bfr499ggo-0_8	AND THEY KIND OF LOOK LIKE CLOWNS THE DESERT SCENE WAS ONE OF THEM
Sqr0AcuoNnk_18	AND SHE TALKS LIKE HER TOO
TvyZBvOMOTc_12	AND BOTH THE ACTORS AMY ADAMS AND MATTHEW GOODE WORK WELL WITH EACH OTHER AND
2iD-tVS8NPw_25	WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR A GREEN LANTERN MOVIE TOO THAT WOULD BE EVEN LIKE WORTHWHILE NOW BECAUSE
LSi-o-IrDMs_25	COOL TO SEE I MEAN EVENTUALLY
nzpVDcQ0ywM_12	I DONT REALLY FEEL ANY EMOTIONAL PULL FROM HIM IN THIS MOVIE
VbQk4H8hgr0_12	ANYTHING ORIGINAL
f_pcplsH_V0_14	BUT IT ACTUALLY BASICALLY MAKES THE CHARACTERS COGNITION NOT JUST OF THE GENRE WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN FRANCHISE TO A RIDICULOUS EXTENT
W8NXH0Djyww_14	HE DID A WONDERFUL JOB
2WGyTLYerpo_1	SAY THAT I REALLY ENJOYED COWBOYS AND ALIENS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_8	SAYING THAT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE SOMEONE OWES YOU AN APOLOGY
LSi-o-IrDMs_9	ITS A MOVIE THE PLOT IS IS IS THREADBARE THE
cM3Yna7AavY_12	I DIDNT REALLY I MEAN TREASURE PLANET WAS OKAY
G6GlGvlkxAQ_22	I THINK THE DIRECTORS OF THOR AND THE SCRIPTWRITERS DID THAT RIGHT AWAY
cW1FSBF59ik_4	I LOVE WHEN THEY SHOW ALL THE THE WAR SCENE CAN BE SPENT IN THE MILITARY INDUSTRY
VCslbP0mgZI_16	AND HAS WAY TOO MUCH VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
bOL9jKpeJRs_12	[UNK]
5W7Z1C_fDaE_3	ITS A FOLD ITS
k5Y_838nuGo_10	I DID LIKE THE 4TH ONE QUITE A BIT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_20	AND UM I I THOUGHT IT WORKED WORKED PRETTY WELL
bvLlb-M3UXU_23	THE FINAL YOU KNOW FINALLY HAPPENED YOU KNOW UNITING THAT WE ALL COME TO EXPECT
8qrpnFRGt2A_7	AND THE STORY WAS PRETTY WEIRD
tIrG4oNLFzE_2	THE NOTEBOOK IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS AND
VCslbP0mgZI_11	SO ZACK SNYDER HERE IS MAKING A MOVIE THATS OSTENSIBLY ABOUT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT BUT ITS A MOVIE ABOUT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT WHICH INCLUDES A LOT OF UM SLAPPING THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF WOMEN AND BUSTY AS THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF VIOLENCE DONE AGAINST WOMEN AND ULTIMATELY IN WHICH MOST OF THE WOMEN END UP COMPLETELY DIS EMPOWERED
_dI--eQ6qVU_25	I JUST LOVED IT
Af8D0E4ZXaw_28	I CANT REALLY BLAME THEM FOR THAT
6_0THN4chvY_5	THE STORY IS PRETTY SIMPLE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_5	BUT I WAS STILL RIDICULOUSLY ENTERTAINED BY IT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_8	UM ITS NOT MY FORM SO
G6GlGvlkxAQ_9	SO THEY COULD KIND OF GET A LITTLE BIT OF CHRISTMAS OR STAR POWER INTO THAT
d3_k5Xpfmik_12	AND I HONESTLY THINK IF IF WE HADNT SEEN WATCHING THIS WOULD BE THE BEST CREDIT SEQUENCE OF THE YEAR
atnd_PF-Lbs_12	PLEASE RESIST FROM THESE TWO
Clx4VXItLTE_28	THATS HOW THEY COPE WITH SCARED AND JUMP AND STUFF
VbQk4H8hgr0_46	IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER
Iu2PFX3z_1s_16	AND SOMETHING THAT I CANT FIND ANYTHING ELSE TO COMPARE IT TO
bOL9jKpeJRs_6	[UNK]
W8NXH0Djyww_1	WAS JUST FANTASTIC SURPRISE
cW1FSBF59ik_15	WOLVERINE SPEECH THE RANDOM BITS THAT NOBODY KNOWS WELL ABOUT CHICKEN BONES WHY MARVEL WAITING FOR YOU SIX ON TORTURING ME
c7UH_rxdZv4_28	HE WAS THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT WAS SLIGHTLY INTERESTING
ZUXBRvtny7o_21	AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE A SEQUEL OF THIS MOVIE BECAUSE
aiEXnCPZubE_15	ACCENT IS SO AWFUL
9c67fiY0wGQ_12	SINCE THE SMURFS ARE SO ADORABLE AND THEY GO ON THRILLING ADVENTURES
BioHAh1qJAQ_26	WHEN THE OLD FLAME FIND THESE THINGS WHATEVER THEY ARE THEY ARE SO WISE AND NAIVE KIND OF LIKE NOT BEING NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_13	IN THAT I DONT END UP CRYING BECAUSE HE IS SO FANTASTIC AND HE JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART WHENEVER HE DOES YOU KNOW A ROLE THAT USUALLY HAS RULES TO BREAK YOUR HEART AT SOME POINT SO DEFINITELY DID IN THIS MOVIE
VCslbP0mgZI_9	UM IF LIKE ME OR SOME OTHER WHITE PERSON OR SPANISH PERSON OR WHATEVER DID THE SAME JOKES IT WOULD NOT BE FUNNY
Clx4VXItLTE_22	AND ITS JUST ITS SO FUNNY
9qR7uwkblbs_20	SHE DIDNT REALLY ACT LIKE ME AT ALL
POKffnXeBds_2	DONT GET ME WRONG KATE HUDSON IS IS PRETTY FINE LOOKING BUT I JUST THINK ITS KIND OF STUPID AND EVERYONE SAYS SHE HAS A FAT ASS
cXypl4FnoZo_5	UM I LIKED IT I THOUGHT CATHERINE HARDWICKE DID A GOOD JOB
73jzhE8R1TQ_4	IT WAS A GOOD BOOK
Bfr499ggo-0_10	THERE ARE A FEW NICE MOMENTS
bvLlb-M3UXU_20	AND I DONT KNOW IF THIS SCENE TOOK PLACE 15 20 YEARS AGO WHEN THESE GUYS WHEN YOURE ABSOLUTE PRIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING MONUMENTAL MOMENT IN CINEMATIC HISTORY BUT
9T9Hf74oK10_25	AND I THINK EARLY ON THE TWIST IS REVEALED
BXuRRbG0Ugk_19	THE IRON MAN FILMS ARE FONDLY REMEMBERED MOSTLY FOR ROBERT DOWNEY JR NOT THE ACTION
f_pcplsH_V0_7	OR ICE CREAM TOO I THINK
Clx4VXItLTE_15	IN MY FRIEND
1iG0909rllw_10	SEVERAL WOMEN WAS IT WAS OKAY JUST AVERAGE
73jzhE8R1TQ_8	IT DID A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THE BACK STORY IN THE BOOK
5W7Z1C_fDaE_15	A HORROR FILM IN THE TRUE SENSE THAT
VbQk4H8hgr0_25	AND I DONT SUGGEST ANYONE GO SEE IT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_21	AND THATS A LOT TO BE SAID FOR ONE MINUTE REVIEW
8d-gEyoeBzc_12	I THOUGHT HE WAS UM WELL DEVELOPED
WKA5OygbEKI_2	RAINBOW IS A REALLY CUTE MOVIE
I5y0__X72p0_12	ERIC BARNETT SAYS TRAIN TO BE THIS MOST PARANOID ASSASSIN CHICK IN THE WORLD BECAUSE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_14	AND SAW TWO WHO UM
9T9Hf74oK10_14	AND EVERYTHING SHE DOES SHE HAS SO MUCH GRACE TO IT AND SO MUCH FLUIDITY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_7	GIVEN ALL THE STRIKES THAT IT HAD GOING AGAINST IT BEFORE IT WENT TO PRODUCTION IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH WORSE
OtBXNcAL_lE_15	THE SAME YOU KNOW RISE AND FALL
k5Y_838nuGo_2	AND IT ACTUALLY SURPRISED ME
MLal-t_vJPM_6	IT IS ITS A GREAT STORY
tStelxIAHjw_1	UM RYAN WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE LAST MOVIE WE SAW IN THEATERS AND TO GIVE A REVIEW FOR IT
etzxEpPuc6I_3	UM FROM THERE ON IT JUST GOES INTO RIDICULOUS NESS
_dI--eQ6qVU_2	AND I LOVED IT
vyB00TXsimI_7	THERE ARE ALSO TWO LORD OF THE RINGS GRADS WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE
ZUXBRvtny7o_22	I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_19	SHE IS ALSO A TERRIFIC ACTRESS
jUzDDGyPkXU_13	BUT ITS NOT ALWAYS QUITE EXPLAINED YOU KNOW LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ANSWER
d3_k5Xpfmik_10	ITS BASICALLY A SLOW MOTION SHOWCASE OF DIFFERENT EVENTS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_8	I THINK YOU WILL REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE EIGHT
9qR7uwkblbs_33	[UNK]
MLal-t_vJPM_4	AND IF YOU DONT HAVE KIDS YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER SEEING IT ANYWAY
8OtFthrtaJM_3	I LITERALLY SAID OUT LOUD WHAT GAY WHAT IS THIS MOVIE THAT I AM SEEING WHAT IS THIS
Jkswaaud0hk_5	A FINE LIGHTWEIGHT DATE MOVIE
MLal-t_vJPM_1	I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT 3D IS REALLY RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_8	BUT IT WAS STILL REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD AND
Njd1F0vZSm4_10	YOU CANT TELL WHICH ARE THE GOOD APPLES WHICH ARE THE BAD APPLES
bvLlb-M3UXU_12	ONLY COMES THROUGH ONE NOW
cXypl4FnoZo_8	BUT UM I I LIKE SEEING UM FEMALE DIRECTORS BECAUSE THERE ARENT THAT MANY ARE COMPARED TO YOU KNOW GUIDE DIRECTORS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_17	AND SO THATS PRETTY ENTERTAINING
ZUXBRvtny7o_9	UM ANYWAYS THE MUSIC IS GOOD
2iD-tVS8NPw_23	IF YOU DONT ENTIRELY KNOW WHATS COMING NEXT
8qrpnFRGt2A_1	AND UM I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS WATCHING THIS I PURPOSELY PUT IT ON BECAUSE I FIGURED IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE STUPID THAT I COULD FALL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AND NOT MISS TOO MUCH
2iD-tVS8NPw_10	AND I JUST HAD FUN WATCHING THIS MOVIE
OQvJTdtJ2H4_6	AND THE CRACKING YOU KNOW IN THE PREVIEW ITS LIKE SO MUCH I
8d-gEyoeBzc_24	ACTUALLY FOUND UM WHEN HES SEEN COME UP AND SLOWED THE MOVIE DOWN UM AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM UM WERE READY TO PREDATORS COMPARED TO THE CREDITOR
k5Y_838nuGo_29	I THINK MANY OF THE PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING ABOUT IT
Nzq88NnDkEk_30	BUT I GOTTA I GOTTA DO MY DUTY YOU GUYS KNOW ITS A MAJOR SUCK FEST
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_2	THE TRAILERS WERENT REALLY DOING MUCH FOR ME
ZUXBRvtny7o_14	IN THE END IT WAS REALLY REALLY GREAT TOO
0h-zjBukYpk_9	YOU KNOW NOTHING GREAT
BXuRRbG0Ugk_4	THERE WAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL LEFT ON THE TABLE
cW1FSBF59ik_9	BUT I DO NOT TAKE RYAN REYNOLDS SERIOUSLY FOR A SHIT IN THIS MOVIE
9T9Hf74oK10_23	ITS NOT ITS NOT LIKE A PERIOD PIECE OR ANYTHING
d6hH302o4v8_8	VERY BORING
f9O3YtZ2VfI_3	IT THEY LOOKED LIKE IT HAD A GOOD CORE
Sqr0AcuoNnk_21	ANOTHER THING IS LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP OR POSITIVE GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN THIS WHOLE MOVIE
tIrG4oNLFzE_6	I MEAN IF IT SPARKS BOOK IT MUST BE GOOD
zhpQhgha_KU_5	BUT I JUST WASNT I JUST I DONT KNOW I DIDNT REALLY LIKE THE MOVIE ALL THAT MUCH
Ci-AH39fi3Y_21	AND UH TOTALLY MADE UP FOR THAT SO THATS OKAY
Qr1Ca94K55A_14	UM BUT IF YOURE AN AVID MOVIEGOER LIKE I AM I TOTALLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS BECAUSE ITS JUST FOR FUN ENTERTAINING MOVIE AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL ENJOY IT
aiEXnCPZubE_14	AND THE OTHER HORRIBLE AND I MEAN ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS COLLEGE I KNOW AS DOCTOR BARRY GORSKI WHO
Vj1wYRQjB-o_4	I WOULDNT WANT THAT POINT AT NIGHT
BvYR0L6f2Ig_12	BUT MOST OF THE ACTORS WAS SO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAYBE THE POLICE CONFIDENCE AND KIMBERLEY
0h-zjBukYpk_8	AND IN MY OPINION HE CARRIED THE MOVIE FINE
zhpQhgha_KU_26	I THINK THAT LIKE A LOT OF ISSUES
8OtFthrtaJM_10	I SHOULD GIVE IT A SHOT YOU KNOW
f_pcplsH_V0_1	SO YOU BETTER APPRECIATE THIS REVIEW
5W7Z1C_fDaE_10	COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING WEVE EVER SEEN THEM DO BEFORE
1iG0909rllw_21	I THINK IT WAS EMPIRE MAGAZINES REVIEW OF NAMING THAT SAID THAT CHRISTIAN RELIED HEAVILY ON THE TACTIC OF TACTIC OF BLINKING A LOT WHICH SHE REALLY DOES DO A LOT
9T9Hf74oK10_12	BUT REGARDLESS I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_10	THE SECOND ONE HAD WOODEN ACTING IN SOME PLACES IM SORRY
9T9Hf74oK10_2	UH PARTICULARLY THE MOVIES THAT I FEEL I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN NOMINATED BUT DIDNT AND NEVER LET ME GO WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE MOVIES
W8NXH0Djyww_24	UM BUT THIS MOVIE IT HAD EVERYTHING HUMOUR ROMANCE ACTION OF
Ci-AH39fi3Y_44	YOU KNOW I GUESS IT BALANCES OUT
aiEXnCPZubE_18	JON HAMM AND SCOTLAND COULD BRING YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE INTERESTING CHARACTERS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_1	GUYS AND HE REALLY SEEMS TO BE CHANNELING MICHAEL BAY IN THIS MOVIE
9T9Hf74oK10_5	IT WAS A PRETTY SLOW MOVIE FOR THE MOST PART
f9O3YtZ2VfI_30	MY NEIGHBOR PROBABLY THINKS IM CRAZY FEELING ABOUT MOVIES TO A CAMERA OH WOW
zhpQhgha_KU_1	I KNOW IM GONNA START OFF BY SAYING THAT I REALLY WASNT VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE MOVIE
2WGyTLYerpo_53	I WASNT A HUGE FAN OF IT
6Egk_28TtTM_2	AND MY FAVORITE CHARACTER DOES IN THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE TO BE MILO MILO IS MOTHER AND GOOD

9qR7uwkblbs_18	AND YEAH I KNOW WE BOTH HAVE THAT AND LIKE AN EASY A
8OtFthrtaJM_22	I HAVE TO SAY MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS THE CHARACTER THOMPSON

GWuJjcEuzt8_4	THEN YOU KNOW IT MAKES YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO ELSE YOU KNOW IN THE INDUSTRY NOWADAYS HAS THE VOICE LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW ITS

VCslbP0mgZI_2	PUNCH CURRENTLY IN THEATERS STARRING NO ONE YOUVE EVER HEARD OF DIRECTORS
pLTX3ipuDJI_3	ALTHOUGH IT WASNT THE SAME WAS THE CONNECTION TO EACH OTHER WITH THE FIRST MOVIE HAD AND THIS ONE LACKED
GWuJjcEuzt8_13	UM THE SONGS IN THE MOVIE ARE WONDERFUL
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_6	WHAT REALLY THREW ME OFF WAS THE DIALOGUE VERY CHEESY DIALOGUE
1iG0909rllw_19	THE BANKS TT NASTY MOMENTS WERE DRAWN OUT TO THE MAX AS FAR AS I COULD GO ON
I5y0__X72p0_29	VISUALLY ITS KINDA COOL HOW THEY SHOW HER CONFUSION BECAUSE SHE GROWS UP IN THE WOODS
BXuRRbG0Ugk_20	AND THE SAME THING HAS MORE OR LESS HAPPENED HERE YEAH THATS RIGHT

Sqr0AcuoNnk_3	AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
tmZoasNr4rU_19	STILL THE THE CHURCH SHOOTOUT HOWEVER BRIEF THAT WAS IT WAS ALL RIGHT
cXypl4FnoZo_11	UM AND YEAH I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GO SEE IT IF YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT SEEING IT BUT YOU WERENT SURE IF IT WOULD BE WORTH SEEING

BXuRRbG0Ugk_24	IS PERFECT FROM START TO FINISH HARRIS
VbQk4H8hgr0_40	AND THE CHARACTERS JUST WERENT THE SAME AS THE FIRST TWO THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM
bvLlb-M3UXU_13	THE SECOND REASON THIS MOVIE WAS MADE AND IN MY OPINION THE REAL REASON IS MADE AGAIN ITS SYLVESTER STALLONE TELLING HIMSELF IVE STILL GOT IT
c7UH_rxdZv4_15	BORING
7JsX8y1ysxY_37	IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS SO OVERWHELMINGLY BAD
6_0THN4chvY_9	BECAUSE HE SAYS ISSUE AND I THINK HES SAYING AT YOU

QN9ZIUWUXsY_11	UM THE DIRECTION IS A BIT ITS WOBBLY
G-xst2euQUc_16	IM NOT REALLY IN A BIG HURRY AT MY AGE TO SEE ANIMATED MOVIES

2WGyTLYerpo_11	ACTION IS REALLY INTENSE WHICH SURPRISED ME I
8OtFthrtaJM_4	I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_21	GOT TWO OF MY FAVORITE ACTRESSES IN IT TILDA SWINTON AND CATE BLANCHETT
Clx4VXItLTE_25	EVERY TIME THERE WAS LIKE A JOKE BUT EVERYONE JOKED
bvLlb-M3UXU_17	BUT HEY WHATEVER AND HE SHOWED THAT YEAH MAYBE HES NOT WHAT HE WAS 20 25 YEARS AGO BUT HE STILL HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE BILLED AS AN ACTION STAR
Qr1Ca94K55A_5	AND HIS ACTING WASNT REALLY GOOD IN THAT MOVIE BUT
OtBXNcAL_lE_8	BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I TOOK A CHANCE
VbQk4H8hgr0_39	BUT I STILL FIND IT POINTLESS IN THE END OF THE MOVIE
f9O3YtZ2VfI_18	THIS LOOKS LIKE IT JUST HAS A POLYURETHANE COATING ON IT
WKA5OygbEKI_8	RAIN GO KIND OF FALLS INTO THAT
PZ-lDQFboO8_8	UH YOU KNOW ALONG WITH THE ZOON I WOULD PROBABLY SAY GO SEE THIS MOVIE AT AN EARLY SHOWING DONT SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE NIGHT VIEWING
Nzq88NnDkEk_19	AND AFTER THE MOVIE UM GOING OUT INTO THE THEATER INTO THE LOBBY I HAD NO ONE I HEARD NO ONE SAY ANYTHING GOOD
2WGyTLYerpo_16	ITS A LOT OF FUN
aiEXnCPZubE_5	THE AVERAGE HORROR FILM THE UNINVITED IN
Nzq88NnDkEk_4	ITS A LITTLE HESITANT AT FIRST YOU KNOW AS YOU ARE WITH WITH REBOOT
2iD-tVS8NPw_6	AND YOU WANT TO SEE IT IN 3D BECAUSE I
2iD-tVS8NPw_27	AND IT DOES KIND OF HELP ALLEVIATE WHAT THAT WHOLE WORRY IS ABOUT FINDING THE ULTIMATE ENEMY WITHIN THIS FIRST MOVIE AND THAT THE THREAT IS STILL THERE POTENTIALLY SPEAKING SO
QN9ZIUWUXsY_15	SO MANY MOMENTS IN THIS MOVIE THAT ARE JUST FRAMED ON THE LIST SO PERFECTLY THAT SO THAT YOU JUST GO LIKE KIND OF BOO THATS REALLY REALLY COOL
Clx4VXItLTE_26	JUMP IN THERE
7JsX8y1ysxY_30	AND HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF ACTING
MLal-t_vJPM_12	ILL GET ANGRY ABOUT IT MICHAEL SARAH DOESNT PLAY THIS CHARACTER IN THIS FILM BUT
8d-gEyoeBzc_29	I DIDNT REALLY FEEL UM THE INCLUSION OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NECESSARY
pLTX3ipuDJI_2	I LIKE TO TEASE SOME MYSTERY AND GREAT PLOT WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN BUT THEN IT ALL GETS EXPLAINED IT DISAPPEARS MINUTES LATER THIS WAS A CLEAR REMAKE OF PREDATOR FROM BACK IN 1987 WITH THE PREMISE BEING ALMOST IDENTICAL
iiK8YX8oH1E_17	BUT HE HAS SOME OF THE FUNNIEST SCENES IN THIS MOVIE
2WGyTLYerpo_19	BUT ONE THING I LIKE THE ALIENS THE EGGS ARE NOT JUST LIKE WE CLING TO HIDE BEHIND THEIR TECHNOLOGY
lXPQBPVc5Cw_23	UM AND THEN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE IT WAS LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON LIKE
tStelxIAHjw_12	LIKE SERIOUSLY
BvYR0L6f2Ig_18	AS WELL AS
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_15	IN IT REALLY JUST LACKED WHAT MADE THEIR MOVIES MORE ENJOYABLE
d6hH302o4v8_12	BORN HES VERY GOOD AT HELL BOY
etzxEpPuc6I_18	THERE WAS PART IS SEEING SOME CREATIVE DEATHS IN THIS MOVIE IVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
LSi-o-IrDMs_5	IN THIS CASE IT DIDNT TAKE MUCH CONVINCING WHICH IS A LITTLE SILLY BUT
0h-zjBukYpk_25	I LIKE THAT SCENE WHERE HE HAD THE SWORD AND THERES A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SHOOT HIM TAKE THAT WITH MY MAGICAL SWORDS
BI97DNYfe5I_19	CAUSE TAKE A BUNCH OF YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU YOU GUYS WILL HAVE A GOOD TIME YOU HAVE
jUzDDGyPkXU_2	ACTION IS REALLY REALLY WELL DIRECTED ITS
BioHAh1qJAQ_27	CLUE WHICH IS THE PROGRAM THAT HE CREATED IN THE FIRST MOVIE KIND OF PULLS A BUNNY IN THE BOILER MOMENT IN THE SENSE THAT HE TURNED INTO A CRAZY JEALOUS PSYCHO STALKER BITCH
5W7Z1C_fDaE_4	STRONG
7JsX8y1ysxY_1	GRAPHICS WERE INCREDIBLE
7JsX8y1ysxY_22	BUT HE WAS AWESOME HERE
6_0THN4chvY_13	ITS A GREAT ONE
Qr1Ca94K55A_10	UM ONE OF THE BIG THINGS I WAS DISAPPOINTED THOUGH WAS I FELT THAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE A LOT MORE WITH 3D
8d-gEyoeBzc_7	UM BUT I DID ENJOY IT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_28	UM SO YOU KNOW THAT WAS A LITTLE SURPRISING I GUESS
lXPQBPVc5Cw_17	IM NOT EVEN KIDDING I I WENT WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS AND A MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE 10 TIMES BETTER WHEN YOURE WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS
5W7Z1C_fDaE_14	ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HATING ON IT I DONT KNOW WHAT THEYRE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT
Vj1wYRQjB-o_6	LIKE I SAID I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT
6Egk_28TtTM_12	BUT IT ALL TURNS OUT GREAT IN THE END
c7UH_rxdZv4_6	IN FACT ID HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE OBNOXIOUS MAIN CHARACTERS IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME
W8NXH0Djyww_17	UM LIKE THIS MOVIE HAD GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES
jUzDDGyPkXU_5	IT DIDNT TURN OUT QUITE NEARLY AS AWESOME AS THAT MOVIE DID
zhpQhgha_KU_17	I REALLY DO THINK THAT I REALLY LIKE THE MIRANDA CHARACTERS ACTUALLY
ZUXBRvtny7o_27	BECAUSE I HAD A GOOD TIME
etzxEpPuc6I_5	I WAS LIKE YOU KNOW THEYRE BOTH HASBRO TOYS OR BOTH MOVIES THAT ARE MADE FOR CHILDREN BUT
Clx4VXItLTE_4	SCARED
HEsqda8_d0Q_15	SO YOU KIND OF FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS THREE DAY THE VOICES
bOL9jKpeJRs_16	[UNK]
9J25DZhivz8_1	THIS MOVIE IS ADORABLE
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_11	MEN IN TIGHTS WHICH NO HILARIOUS SPOOF OF THE STORY
v0zCBqDeKcE_7	GENIUS I MEAN SOME PEOPLE LIKE JAMES WOODS I BELIEVE HIS IQ IS ONE 180 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
9qR7uwkblbs_23	AND I WAS THINKING LIKE IF I CAN BE MOTHER FUCKING EMMA STONE AND CHRIS CAN BE RYAN GOSLING AND IT WOULD BE GREAT DIDNT REALLY HAPPEN THIS MOVIE
v0zCBqDeKcE_13	IF YOUR UM LOVE OF JIM CARREY I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOULL LIKE THIS MOVIE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_5	I GO TO LIKE SOME OR ALL OF THESE TYPES ZONES I GUESS LIKE THE OLDER PICTURE FILMS LIKE TOY STORY AND ALL THAT STUFF
G-xst2euQUc_1	IT WAS A REALLY CUTE MOVIE I
GWuJjcEuzt8_1	UM FIRST THINGS FIRST CHRISTINA AGUILERA AS PIPES I SWEAR THEY UM DID THAT UM
HEsqda8_d0Q_20	BUT GENERALLY THE ACCENTS WERE REALLY REALLY GOOD
cXypl4FnoZo_1	WHEN YOU SEE RED RIDING HOOD FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND
Oz06ZWiO20M_24	ITS REALLY LIKE IF YOU WENT TO GO SEE THE BALLET AND ITS ABOUT THE SPECTACLES
9c67fiY0wGQ_8	I RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO CHILDREN SIX AND UP
jUzDDGyPkXU_7	I DIDNT REALLY SEE A COMPARISON TO BLACK HAWK DOWN UNTIL LIKE THE VERY VERY END
VbQk4H8hgr0_18	AND THERE WAS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER PLEASE
I5y0__X72p0_11	IT WAS IT WAS AND IT WAS AN OKAY MOVIE BASICALLY
etzxEpPuc6I_16	BUT THE MOVIE WAS WHILE IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY TERRIBLE LIKE
BI97DNYfe5I_18	UM I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU GO SEE IN THEATERS
iiK8YX8oH1E_4	IF YOU CAN TOLERATE HER THE REST OF THE MOVIE ISNT ANY BETTER
BioHAh1qJAQ_21	THIS CONNECTION THAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT BECAUSE
pLTX3ipuDJI_14	ITS A POINTLESS SCENE FOR THE AUDIENCE FOR THE CHARACTERS
TvyZBvOMOTc_1	WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER NAME FOR THE MOVIE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_6	ARE THESE TWO THINGS POSSIBLE IN THE SAME SENTENCE I I REALLY DO THINK SO
G6GlGvlkxAQ_13	AND IT SHOWS WITH THE NBC RECENT FLOP OF THE CAKE WHICH IS A SHOW I LOVED
wMbj6ajWbic_7	THE ACTING IS A LITTLE ROUGH IN SOME PARTS OF
Oz06ZWiO20M_20	AND THEN YOU KNOW PUT IN SOME ACTION OR SOME ROMANCE AND SEX OR WHATEVER TO KEEP PEOPLE ENGAGED
VbQk4H8hgr0_36	AND NONE OF THEM WERE REALLY THAT GREAT AND IT STANDS OUT IN YOUR MIND
Af8D0E4ZXaw_21	UM AND IN FACT IN SPITE OF ALL THE NEGATIVES I DONT WANT TO MENTION I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS WORKING FOR A WHILE FOR ABOUT THE FIRST 3RD UH BUT AT THE END OF ACT 12 SIGNIFICANT THINGS HAPPEN AFTER HAMMOND ARRIVES
2iD-tVS8NPw_9	AND THE REST OF IT DOES LOOK GOOD AS WELL
VbQk4H8hgr0_32	IT WASNT EVEN REMOTELY GOOD
ZUXBRvtny7o_16	THE MAIN PROBLEM OF THIS MOVIE IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS SO CHEESY
vvZ4IcEtiZc_8	ITS TRULY HEARTBREAKING TO SEE THAT CONTRASTED WITH THE STATE OF THINGS
VbQk4H8hgr0_19	AND SIMPLY IT WAS DULL FOR ME
IumbAb8q2dM_9	UM I REALLY WANT TO GO READ THE BOOK NOW BECAUSE
8d-gEyoeBzc_4	AS YOU KNOW AS ALIENS WAS TOO ALIEN
atnd_PF-Lbs_16	THE WAVES PULL IT OFF ITS LIKE WHOA THAT WAS SICK
Ci-AH39fi3Y_11	AND THE OTHER ONE WAS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
nzpVDcQ0ywM_2	THE PLOT HAS THE CONSISTENCY OF SWISS CHEESE
VCslbP0mgZI_6	THERE ARE SOME REALLY COOL MOMENTS IN THIS CITY
Oz06ZWiO20M_15	IT REALLY HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH A MUSICAL OR AN OPERA OR EVEN A BALLET THAN A REGULAR NARRATIVE FILM CAUSE LIKE I AM
cXypl4FnoZo_19	UM BUT YEAH WHATEVER UH HE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HIM BECAUSE THEY WERENT SHOWING HIM A LOT BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN UP TO THEY CANNOT BE LIKE OH IT WAS HIM AT THE END
iiK8YX8oH1E_14	LIKE I SAID KATE HUDSON COULDNT BE MORE ANNOYING HERE
OtBXNcAL_lE_19	SOMETHING ALONG THIS VIDEO BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH ALAN
OtBXNcAL_lE_18	BLAH BLAH BLAH
9J25DZhivz8_22	THERE WAS A LOT OF CHEAP CHILD HUMOR WHICH
03bSnISJMiM_2	THEY DID THEY DIDNT REALLY DO A FULL BUNCH OF FACTORS AND SO ON WHY SHE HAS TO TO FIGHT AND BE PREPARED
bvLlb-M3UXU_25	JUST DISAPPOINTING I WISH THIS HAD HAPPENED EARLIER IN YOUR CAREER SO
BioHAh1qJAQ_4	EVERYTHING AND NOW TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY DOES ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING BECAUSE
tmZoasNr4rU_1	I WANT TO QUICKLY TALK ABOUT MACHETE
VbQk4H8hgr0_49	IM GONNA WRITE THIS ONE TWO STARS
IumbAb8q2dM_11	I HEARD THAT IN THE BOOK IT DESCRIBES UM THE PLANET OF GLORY AND A LOT BETTER
ZUXBRvtny7o_19	NOT LIKE THE CHARACTERS OF CLIMATE
_dI--eQ6qVU_10	AND THE HUMOR IT WAS KIND OF NECESSARY
atnd_PF-Lbs_19	THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF BEING SICK NOWADAYS
VCslbP0mgZI_3	OUR LAND OR WHATEVER THEY CAME OUT AND I NEVER SAW
d3_k5Xpfmik_19	THE STYLE OF THE FILM MIGHT BE UH THE FREEZE FRAMES OF SLOW MOTION THE UH THE JUMP CUTS AND ALL THAT STUFF FEELS VERY KIND OF UM TARANTINO ASK
9c67fiY0wGQ_3	I THINK THE MOVIE REALLY DEPICTED THE LIVELINESS OF NEW YORK CITY WELL SINCE IM A NEW YORKER MYSELF
d6hH302o4v8_36	UH HOW ABOUT THE ACTING AND ACTION WAS IT WAS SO DULL
2WGyTLYerpo_59	I REALLY ENJOYED COWBOYS AND ALIENS EITHER
9J25DZhivz8_10	STEVE CARROLL VOICES GREW AND RUSSELL BRAND ACTUALLY REALLY IMPRESSED ME WITH HIS OLD MAN VOICE FOR THE DOCTOR
Qr1Ca94K55A_13	NOW I DONT REALLY RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU GO ON A DATE WITH SOME GIRL
BI97DNYfe5I_9	UM I STILL HAD FUN WITH IT
HEsqda8_d0Q_18	BUT AS AN ENGLISH PERSON I GET REALLY ANNOYED WHEN AMERICAN SHOWS AND FILMS HAVE AN ENGLISH CHARACTER
MLal-t_vJPM_3	YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR KIDS
I5y0__X72p0_22	UM I I AT THE END OF THE MOVIE THE FRIENDS I WAS WITH ONE OF THOSE WAS THERE A PLOT TO THIS MOVIE
f_pcplsH_V0_12	IM SURE YOU ALL REMEMBER THE STAB MOVIES THAT WERE BASED ON THE SCREAM MOVIES UH THE EXPERIENCES OF SYDNEY IN THE UNIVERSE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD COMMENT ON THE KILLERS REACTING THE MOVIES ARE FOLLOWING UP THE MOVIES WELL IN THE FIRST HOUR THOSE BECOME WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH OF A PLOT POINT BASICALLY
POKffnXeBds_12	TWO GIRLS TRYING TOO HARD
8qrpnFRGt2A_2	I JUST WANTED SOMETHING TO WATCH MODELS FALL ASLEEP
7JsX8y1ysxY_25	BUT HE WAS INCREDIBLE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_16	DEFINITELY A LITTLE BIT ABOVE AVERAGE
8qrpnFRGt2A_23	AND THERES A LOT OF IT
rnaNMUZpvvg_22	START WITH THE GUYS AND WE ALL TRY TO STAY AWAKE THROUGH IT AND KEPT FALLING ASLEEP ON THEN TALK ABOUT HOW STUPID IT WAS
8qrpnFRGt2A_26	BRICK WALLS AS FAR AS LIKE JUST C GI HEAVY LIKE THERES TIMES WHEN THERES LIKE A HUMAN FACE AND EVERYTHING AROUND THAT FACES CARTOON C GI COMPUTER EFFECTS
c7UH_rxdZv4_27	AND UM YEAH I THINK THE ONLY CHARACTER WHO ACTUALLY SHOWED THEIR MOTIVATIONS BEHIND ANYTHING THEY DID WAS THE VILLAIN
c7UH_rxdZv4_1	OH MY GOSH BAD MOVIE
zhpQhgha_KU_2	AND I LIKED THE FIRST MOVIE IT WAS THE FIRST MOVIE WAS REALLY GOOD
8d-gEyoeBzc_1	UM IM GOING TO GIVE THE REASONS WHY I LIKE HIM
cM3Yna7AavY_6	ANYWAY YOU CAN SEE IM STILL SPEECHLESS THIS MOVIE WAS BEAUTIFUL
PZ-lDQFboO8_6	UH BUT AS FAR AS HUMOR GOES NOT AS MUCH AS I WAS EXPECTING
1iG0909rllw_22	BUT THEN THE SAME GOES FOR UM BROADCASTERS EDWARDS AND TAYLOR LAUTNER AS JACOB THEY DO A LOT OF RUNNING IM A MANLY MAN AND I FROWN
BioHAh1qJAQ_19	THE CHOREOGRAPHY OF THE FIGHTS THE SPECIAL EFFECTS I WAS SO HAPPY TO BE BACK IN THE GRID THAT I WASNT REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE STORY OR WHERE THE STORY WAS GOING
0h-zjBukYpk_14	ITS A SMART MOVE SINCE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE A REAL COMIC BOOK FAN TO GET WHAT HIS NAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE
c5xsKMxpXnc_6	THEY LEFT A LOT OF PLOT HOLES
dq3Nf_lMPnE_10	AND ALSO THE CUTE WINKS TO POP CULTURE
8d-gEyoeBzc_8	SO IM GONNA POINT OUT THE STUFF I DID LIKE UM THERE WAS SOME GOOD ACTION SCENES IN IT
9J25DZhivz8_19	I MEAN MY STOMACH WAS ALMOST GOING AS WE WENT DOWN THE BIG DROP
9qR7uwkblbs_17	LIKE I KIND OF SOUND LIKE I MIGHT HAVE A PENIS
ZUXBRvtny7o_29	BUT IT WAS REALLY GOOD
vyB00TXsimI_11	WHICH BASICALLY MEANS HES WORM TONGUE AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT WAY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_34	AND IT PRETTY MUCH JUST LEFT THE DOOR WIDE OPEN FOR SUSSEX WHICH OBVIOUSLY
IumbAb8q2dM_13	UM I CANT WAIT TILL THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT TO UH
HEsqda8_d0Q_4	WASNT EXPECTING TO BECAUSE
IumbAb8q2dM_7	UM USUALLY IM NOT REALLY A HUGE SIGH 5 MILLION CANADA A FAN BUT
bvLlb-M3UXU_14	UM I GOTTA GIVE HIM CREDIT
Clx4VXItLTE_18	BUT I AM IT WAS JUMPING LIKE
Ci-AH39fi3Y_18	THEY WERENT YOU KNOW INTRODUCED WELL REALLY
2WGyTLYerpo_34	DOESNT TAKE CRAP FROM ANYBODY
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_17	I DONT THINK ITS AS BAD AS YOU PROBABLY READ ON REVIEWS
Jkswaaud0hk_12	UH I THOUGHT WOODY HARRELSON WAS UH FUNNY
tmZoasNr4rU_9	IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HELPED IF I WENT WITH WITH SOMEONE IF AT LEAST ONE OTHER PERSON WELL WITH ME
tStelxIAHjw_6	I LIKE FINDING NEMO
zhpQhgha_KU_35	UM SO IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR A MORE POSITIVE REVIEW CHECK OUT HER REVIEW IT IS VERY GOOD UM
fvVhgmXxadc_8	I DONT KNOW EITHER
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_20	I CAN APPRECIATE THAT
rnaNMUZpvvg_10	EVEN HE WAS A DOUCHE BAG ALL OF THEM AND
BI97DNYfe5I_27	I EXPECTED A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUSNESS
WKA5OygbEKI_17	THIS REALLY QUIRKY LITTLE CHAMELEON
Clx4VXItLTE_19	UH ONE HELL OF A LOT OF TIMES
yDtzw_Y-7RU_24	WOULD NOT TAKE A YOUNG CHILD
1iG0909rllw_3	I THOUGHT TWILIGHT DIRECTED BY CATHERINE HARDWICKE WAS ACTUALLY REALLY RATHER ENJOYABLE
HEsqda8_d0Q_29	UH ITS NOT MY FAVOURITE FILM EVER
yDtzw_Y-7RU_16	AND THROUGHOUT THE FILM YOU GOING EITHER FROM THE TERRIFIED CHARACTERS OR
OtBXNcAL_lE_21	I MEAN YOU CAN GO SEE IT I PERSONALLY DIDNT LIKE IT BECAUSE
Jkswaaud0hk_1	MILLER COOLNESS AND JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE I THOUGHT THEY MADE A GREAT DUO MILLER KUHN IS SHE
VbQk4H8hgr0_54	IT WASNT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION TO GO SEE SO
G-xst2euQUc_13	IF IT WAS IN HALF THE WAY HE DID THE SINGING SHE DID A GREAT JOB
9qR7uwkblbs_24	ITS KIND OF SAD ABOUT THAT THOUGH
7JsX8y1ysxY_15	JUNIOR LADY GIRL I DONT KNOW I MEAN SHE LOOKED FANTASTIC
Vj1wYRQjB-o_7	THE ACTION THEY DO HAVE IS REALLY WELL DONE
LSi-o-IrDMs_27	AGAIN WE GET BURNED OUT ON 3D BECAUSE ITS
Jkswaaud0hk_16	I DO THINK ITS WORTH SEEING
2WGyTLYerpo_31	I THINK HE DOES A GREAT JOB WITH WHAT HE DOES HES
d6hH302o4v8_43	SO SEIZING THE WITCH IS THERE A 3 OUT OF 10 SO
aiEXnCPZubE_16	AND IT WAS ITS RIDICULOUS AND
VbQk4H8hgr0_48	AND I LOVED IT AND THIS ONE JUST WAS A FLOOD OF DISAPPOINTMENT SO
8qrpnFRGt2A_13	BUT THATS JUST ME
GWuJjcEuzt8_10	DOC SAYS UM WONDERFUL
7JsX8y1ysxY_6	IT WAS REALLY FUNNY
OtBXNcAL_lE_23	UM AND ITS REALLY UNPREDICTABLE
vyB00TXsimI_15	I REALLY LOVE THE MELODRAMATIC OVER THE TOP CRAZY ACTION SORT OF THING GOING ON
jUzDDGyPkXU_25	THATS ALL RIGHT AND MOVING ON THERES NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN THIS MOVIE NONE
GWuJjcEuzt8_8	FEEL LIKE YOUR FACE IS GONNA FALL APART
wMbj6ajWbic_29	HE DOES A GREAT JOB OF SNAKE GUYS ITS ALWAYS COOL TO SEE THAT
ZUXBRvtny7o_31	DID A COUPLE OF CHARACTERS MAKE THIS MOVIE ARE REALLY GOOD MOVIE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_2	A LAST MINUTE TITLE THAT THEY THREW OUT AT THE THEATERS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_15	HES PRETTY AVERAGE TO
Oz06ZWiO20M_23	AND THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL JUST PLACE HOLDERS
vyB00TXsimI_12	OTHER NOTABLE MENTIONS ARE CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER PLAYS
bOL9jKpeJRs_22	[UNK]
BioHAh1qJAQ_17	AND THEN TELL THE GAMES LOOK GREAT
iiK8YX8oH1E_13	BUT I DONT THINK SHES LEADING MATERIAL AND
73jzhE8R1TQ_3	MAYBE BECAUSE NUMBER FOUR WAS NOT MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOKS
7JsX8y1ysxY_17	SHE LOOKS LIKE A SUPERHERO
tIrG4oNLFzE_8	EXPECT MILEY CYRUS SLOW DOWN HANNAH MONTANA FRANCHISE PLAYING THAT ONE CHARACTER WHICH I THINK LIKE 99 OF THE TIME HER CHARACTER LIKE SKY WERE GORGEOUS SO EXAGGERATED SO I REALLY DIDNT KNOW HOW SHE WAS GOING TO HANDLE THE FILMS TRAILER
wMbj6ajWbic_3	OR A BIG COLLECTOR OF THE ACTION FIGURES
bOL9jKpeJRs_30	[UNK]
I5y0__X72p0_3	AS THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEYRE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONVINCE ME THAT A 16 YEAR OLD GIRL CAN TAKE DOWN LIKE SIX ADULT DUDES
7JsX8y1ysxY_36	AND UH THERES NOT IN MY OPINION THERE WASNT VERY MUCH OF A BALANCE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL KIND OF THING
2iD-tVS8NPw_3	ENJOYED IT FOR WHAT IT WAS YOU KNOW
cXypl4FnoZo_21	AND WE WISH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PETER BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE THAT UM PETER
9qR7uwkblbs_8	WRESTLING THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE IM NOT
zhpQhgha_KU_10	UM I MEAN IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE SHOW WHEN YOU REALLY LIKED THE FIRST MOVIE AND YOU STILL WANT TO GO SEE THE SECOND ONE IM NOT GOING TO DISCOURAGE YOU FROM SEEING IT
5W7Z1C_fDaE_18	BEING RELEASED IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_10	WHEN I SAW THE FIRST TRAILER BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY SHOT UP NEAR THE TOP OF MY LIST OF MUST SEE MOVIES FOR 2011 THE FINAL
tmZoasNr4rU_8	BUT BUT I JUST DIDNT LAUGH
lXPQBPVc5Cw_4	I MEAN AND I DONT ACTUALLY GO AND IM NOT BEING BIASED BECAUSE I DONT REALLY GO FOR THE ANIMATED TYPE FILMS
Clx4VXItLTE_2	VOTE FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO LOVES HORROR MOVIES AND
BioHAh1qJAQ_7	BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE FIRST 3RD OF THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING
03bSnISJMiM_7	BESIDES THAT IT WAS ALL OVER PRETTY GOOD
yDtzw_Y-7RU_17	MOST LIKELY FROM GOING VERY QUICKLY THROUGH LONDON WITH YOU NO DEMON HORSES CHASING YOU SO UH THERES THAT
tStelxIAHjw_3	I REALLY DID
8d-gEyoeBzc_14	SOMEONE YOU CARE ABOUT
etzxEpPuc6I_8	IN SOME PARTS OF EUROPE PEOPLE GETTING KILLED IN THE NEXT PART YOU HAD FART JOKES AND STUPID FRAT HUMOUR AND ALL THAT OTHER CRAP
Ci-AH39fi3Y_30	TO THE END WAS BETTER THAN THE ENDING WHICH
lXPQBPVc5Cw_12	JUST WONDERING IF YOU DID NOT WORK FOR ME THE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_8	NOW IT ISNT A GREAT FANTASTIC TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT IT KIND OF MOVIE
_dI--eQ6qVU_28	AND I WOULD WANT TO SEE THE SEQUENCE IS TO BE EVEN LONGER RATHER THAN SHORTER
Af8D0E4ZXaw_23	AND HOW JORDAN FLIES OFF TO THE GREEN LANTERN CORPS PLANET OF POWER AND THE MOVIE STARTS SEQUEL BAITING
c5xsKMxpXnc_4	WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THE CONCEPT WAS COOL THERE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_5	I FEEL LIKE IT ALMOST SHOULD HAVE HAD A GRATING
1DmNV9C1hbY_13	FILM BUT OTHERWISE I DONT KNOW
phBUpBr1hSo_3	I THINK THE MOVIES ARE PHENOMENAL ESPECIALLY THAT FIRST ONE
cW1FSBF59ik_5	THATS FREAKING EPIC
7JsX8y1ysxY_24	UM HE WAS AWESOME
d6hH302o4v8_20	THE TRAILER LOOKED LIKE IT COULD BE A LITTLE GOOD
cW1FSBF59ik_3	IM PRETTY SURE THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN KIND OF FREAKED OUT THE WHOLE TIME YOU KNOW
G6GlGvlkxAQ_27	ITS NOT LIKE HE LEARNED FROM THE EARTHLINGS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_4	SO NOT ONLY DID THIS MOVIE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BURDEN OF TELLING ITS OWN SELF CONTAINED STORY AND SETTING UP ITS OWN INEVITABLE SEQUELS
BioHAh1qJAQ_1	BECAUSE IM A BIG FAN OF THE FIRST RUN
BXuRRbG0Ugk_23	AND NOW THAT IVE SEEN HIM IN THE ROLE I CANT IMAGINE ANY OTHER CURRENT ACTOR TRYING TO PULL IT OFF
aiEXnCPZubE_28	MY CANDY AND JUST
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_14	AND THE DIALOGUE THREW ME OFF THE OTHER
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_9	BUT PEOPLE COULD HATE ABOUT THIS MOVIE THERE ARE SOME NEGATIVES TO SAY THE LEAST
f9O3YtZ2VfI_12	ANOTHER THING IS WE DONT NEED HIS ENTIRE LIFE
vyB00TXsimI_22	AND THERE ACTUALLY WAS ONE SCENE THAT I FOUND
tStelxIAHjw_4	I THINK IM GETTING TO THAT POINT WHERE IM JUST NOT ENTERTAINED BY DISNEY PIX OR MOVIES ANYMORE BECAUSE I COULDNT STAND UP
VCslbP0mgZI_4	THIS SUCKER IS GETTING THIS SUMMER IS GETTING PANNED LIKE LAST AIR BENDER GARBAGE PAN AND I WANNA SAY THIS I DID NOT I THINK IT WAS LIKE LAST AIR BENDER GARBAGE
bvLlb-M3UXU_6	NOT A COMPLICATED STORY BUT
yDtzw_Y-7RU_10	SOMETIMES I MISS WHAT WAS BEING SAID
Af8D0E4ZXaw_14	GREAT ADDITIONS
rnaNMUZpvvg_11	EVERY SINGLE COWBOY WHICH IS A COMPLETE DOUCHE BAG
aiEXnCPZubE_23	COULD HAVE INTERESTING BACK STORIES
9T9Hf74oK10_10	THEY WERENT FULLY EXPLORED
VbQk4H8hgr0_29	IS SPLIT ON THIS ONE JUST AS THEY WERE WITH SPIDER MAN
1DmNV9C1hbY_11	BUT FOR ME I WAS JUST A LITTLE BORED
Ci-AH39fi3Y_24	BUT THE END WAS REALLY YOU KNOW
8qrpnFRGt2A_19	I I GUESS UH BUT THE FUNNY THING IS UH I MEAN THE FUNNY THING IS DESPITE AND DESPITE EVERYTHING BAD ABOUT THIS MOVIE I ENDED UP ACTUALLY LIKING IT
Ci-AH39fi3Y_1	IM STILL EXCITED ABOUT IT
I5y0__X72p0_21	AND SO THEY KIND OF EXPLAIN IT A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT REALLY
c5xsKMxpXnc_14	THERES NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD BE TOGETHER
Clx4VXItLTE_21	THAT MUST FEEL LIKE EVERYONE JUST SCREAMS IN
Oz06ZWiO20M_10	UM IT REALLY IS NOT TRYING TO BE A DRAMATIC FILM OR AN ACTION FILM
bOL9jKpeJRs_2	WAS FULL OF ACTION
TvyZBvOMOTc_4	AND IN THE SEAM OF THE DESTROYED CASTLE IT REALLY REMINDED ME WHY I WANT TO GO THERE SO BADLY
phBUpBr1hSo_16	AND YOU JUST KIND OF LIKE OKAY LETS GET TO IT WE KNOW WHATS GONNA HAPPEN LETS GO AHEAD AND DO IT
ZAIRrfG22O0_8	AND YOURE BETTER OFF SAVING YOUR MONEY UH AND MAYBE RENTING IT WHEN IT COMES OUT ON VIDEO SO
rnaNMUZpvvg_13	BUT HE WASNT EVEN INTERESTING
LSi-o-IrDMs_29	UM BUT I WILL SAY I MEAN WITH THIS WITH THIS QUALITY OF 3D YOU COULD ALMOST MAKE YOU KNOW A REGULAR LIKE A DRAMATIC MOVIE OR AN ACTION MOVIE OR SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY A GOOD MOVIE AND YOU CAN MAKE IT 3D AND IT WOULDNT AT ALL
fvVhgmXxadc_1	IT CERTAINLY HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A FILM THAT WAS BOTH THOUGHT PROVOKING AND ACTION PACKED
Ci-AH39fi3Y_12	THE GREAT PLOT WAS WITH HOFFMAN TYING UP ALL LOOSE ENDS AND STUFF
X3j2zQgwYgE_8	AND I GUESS NORMALLY SHREK IS FOR ADULTS
9T9Hf74oK10_1	THIS FUCKING MOVIE
8d-gEyoeBzc_30	UM IT COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN OUT
lXPQBPVc5Cw_9	BUT IT WAS JUST IT WAS LIKE IM NOT GONNA EVEN LIE TO YOU GUYS I FELL ASLEEP AROUND THE MIDDLE OF IT AND WOKE UP LIKE JUST HAPPENED
I5y0__X72p0_31	IT WAS ORIGINALLY
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_9	LIKE THE HUMOR REDEEMED THE MOVIE FOR BEING SO BAD IN THE DIALOGUE DEPARTMENT
wMbj6ajWbic_24	MARLON WAYNES A LOT OF FUN
f_pcplsH_V0_2	BUT FOR ANY OF YOU OR I EXPECT THE THUMBS UP
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_22	I CANT DO IT
tmZoasNr4rU_16	I FEEL THAT THE MOVIE WASNT REALLY CONCERNED WITH BEING EXCITING
I5y0__X72p0_24	ITS NOT LIKE A REALLY GOOD TWIST
BI97DNYfe5I_14	PLAYED KATO PERFECTLY AND
Nzq88NnDkEk_24	BUT HEY IF YOURE LOOKING TO SPEND SOME MONEY GO CHECK IT OUT MAYBE YOU WILL LIKE IT BUT
5W7Z1C_fDaE_24	ABSOLUTELY NOT TO BE MISSED
Bfr499ggo-0_18	IF YOURE A FAN IM DOING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_25	PAINFUL TO WATCH
rnaNMUZpvvg_20	LOOKED AWESOME WHILE HE DID IT BUT YEAH OKAY SO LIKE ALL THE GIRLS WHO WENT ALL DISAGREE WITH ME I THINK IT WAS AN AMAZING MOVIE BUT THEY ALL THINK IT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE THEY WERE STARING AT DANIEL CRAIG GIRL IF IM GOING OH MY GOSH SHES SO HOT
Bfr499ggo-0_20	THE WRITING ISNT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST
_dI--eQ6qVU_27	WHY NOT IF I WAS WEARING 3D GLASSES AND WERE SEEING THIS IN 3D I WOULD ENJOY IT A LOT MORE
yDtzw_Y-7RU_13	UH ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT DEBTORS PRISON FOR INSTANCE DOESNT REALLY JIVE HERE IN 21ST CENTURY AMERICA
9qR7uwkblbs_10	AND YOU SHOULD ALL GO OUT AND SEE IT AND YOU KNOW STUFF
fvVhgmXxadc_4	IN FACT I GOT MOSTLY PAIN OUT OF IT
ob23OKe5a9Q_1	[UNK]
Clx4VXItLTE_29	FROM THERE IT DOES GET A BIT LIKE NOT AS REAL AS WHAT IS BEING GOING ON
LSi-o-IrDMs_8	EVERYTHING IS OK
bvLlb-M3UXU_10	THE FIRST REASON IS THE OBVIOUS JUST TO MAKE A EXCITING ENJOYABLE ACTION FILM
BioHAh1qJAQ_14	THE SPECIAL EFFECTS LOOK AMAZING
BI97DNYfe5I_21	YOU LAUGH
d6hH302o4v8_41	JUST DONT SEE THIS MOVIE
vvZ4IcEtiZc_9	THERE ARE LOTS OF THERE ARE SO MANY DYNAMICS GOING ON WITH THIS RELATIONSHIP AND I THINK THAT IT WAS IT WAS A GREAT STORY
rnaNMUZpvvg_12	AND THEN THERES THIS LITTLE BOY AND HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO WASNT A DOUCHE BAG
jUzDDGyPkXU_19	IN THIS MOVIE IS CLEVERLY WRITTEN EVERYTHING
Sqr0AcuoNnk_11	BUT IT HAD A LOT OF REALLY BAD MOMENTS
2WGyTLYerpo_56	LIKE A MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD THINK WOULD BE KIND OF CRAZY
jUzDDGyPkXU_16	IT KEEPS YOUR INTEREST IN THE ACTION SCENES AT LEAST DURING THIS MOVIE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_26	THEY DIDNT BELABOR THORNTON
phBUpBr1hSo_6	AND HE SAID THAT THIS NEW ONE HAS A LOT OF HARD UM SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE
BvYR0L6f2Ig_1	AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS WORK ON THE FIRST ONE
v0zCBqDeKcE_8	JIM CARREY EWAN MCGREGOR I LIKE THE TWO OF THEM
nzpVDcQ0ywM_16	THE TWO WOMEN IN THIS MOVIE ARE PARTICULARLY GOOD LOOKING
TvyZBvOMOTc_11	A LOT OF THIS MOVIE BRINGS A CUTE LAUGH HERE AND THERE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_19	AND HIS PERFORMANCE IS CAN BE AND COMES OFF AS AN ARMY CHEERLEADER SOME OF THE TIME
bOL9jKpeJRs_20	[UNK]
bvLlb-M3UXU_3	LITTLE TO NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT ALL MOVIE
nzpVDcQ0ywM_4	ALL IN ALL ITS KIND OF A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ANY OF US WHO GREW UP IN THE EIGHTIES AND ARE USED TO THE TOYS IN THE CARTOON
BXuRRbG0Ugk_1	COWBOYS AND ALIENS METAPHORICAL SPEAKING IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE NFL TEAMS THAT HAS THE TALENT TO BE A SUPER BOWL CHAMPION BUT INSTEAD ENDS UP BEING A WILD CARD TEAM THAT GETS DISMISSED IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE PLAYOFFS
Nzq88NnDkEk_11	IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS NO STORY DEVELOPMENT IN IT
f_pcplsH_V0_6	ITS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN SCREAM TOO
VCslbP0mgZI_17	IF I DONT GIVE ZACK SNYDER THE BENEFIT OF DOUBT
2WGyTLYerpo_52	I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING THAT
8qrpnFRGt2A_11	WHICH I MEAN FOR A MOVIE ABOUT G I JOE 90 MINUTES IS ENOUGH
POKffnXeBds_1	CAN I SAY I IM JUST CURIOUS
9J25DZhivz8_14	I THOUGHT HE WAS EXCELLENT AS FOR 3D I
nbWiPyCm4g0_3	THIS MOVIE ISNT JUST BAD ITS DIABOLICAL
0h-zjBukYpk_2	NOW IM NOT GOING TO SUGARCOAT THIS THIS MOVIE FRUSTRATED ME TO SUCH AN EXTREME EXTENT THAT I WAS LOUDLY EXCLAIMING WHY AT THE END OF THE FILM
zhpQhgha_KU_14	BUT A LOT OF THE FOOTAGE WAS KIND OF A MESS
9J25DZhivz8_6	THIS WAS PROBABLY THE BEST 3D MOVIE IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME CAUSE IT ACTUALLY USED 3D TOY STORY
wMbj6ajWbic_23	I THINK UM RACHEL NICHOLS HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH HER ROLE
WKA5OygbEKI_15	I MEAN JOHNNY DEPP SOME WONDERFUL VOICE ACTOR SO UM HE HES I THINK HES AN INCREDIBLE VOICE ACTOR LIKE
Clx4VXItLTE_3	LIKE I DO JUMP
vyB00TXsimI_9	IF ALL THREE OF THEM WERE PUT TOGETHER
2iD-tVS8NPw_26	I MEAN IF HES ABLE TO DO ALL OF THIS SORT OF STUFF LIKE HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO REALLY PUT UP A FORCE THAT CAN PUSH HIM TO THE NEXT LEVEL OR OR DESTROY HIM AT THE SAME TIME
cM3Yna7AavY_5	OH OH MY GOSH I WAS BLOWN AWAY
0h-zjBukYpk_16	UM I ACTUALLY THINK WE TRIGGER IS A GOOD ACTOR
Ci-AH39fi3Y_16	AND IM PRETTY SURE THATS BECAUSE IT DIDNT TIE INTO THE MOVIE AT ALL SO
1DmNV9C1hbY_12	SURE THERE ARE LITTLE CUTE BUNNY PARKS IN MIXED IN WITH THE
vyB00TXsimI_5	AND ITS FUN TO WATCH
VbQk4H8hgr0_2	I LOVE THE FIRST TRACK ON THE SECOND TRACK AND
73jzhE8R1TQ_2	IT WASNT LIKE IT WASNT LIKE OH THE BOOK WAS SO MUCH HARDER TO MOVIE
tStelxIAHjw_14	I GUESS IM JUST OVER IT
atnd_PF-Lbs_10	ITS A JOKE REALLY
MLal-t_vJPM_2	YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON
6_0THN4chvY_7	UM FUNNY JOKES THAT THE KIDS WILL GET
pLTX3ipuDJI_6	OF REACTING NOTHING STANDS OUT IS SPECTACULAR WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED OF A MOVIE LIKE THIS
BioHAh1qJAQ_23	AND THE WHOLE MOVIE BECOMES ABOUT THIS CRAZY II
0h-zjBukYpk_15	BUT ITS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
BXuRRbG0Ugk_21	IN A MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS DANIEL CRAIG STEALS THE WHOLE DANG SHOW
cW1FSBF59ik_22	ALTHOUGH I DO AGREE THAT THE LOOK COULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO FIT THE ACTUAL SAVE A TOOTH LIKE WITH THE RIGHT HAIR
v0zCBqDeKcE_4	UM I SHOULD SAY ITS NOT LIKE AMAZINGLY GONNA WIN SOME AWARDS TO

k5Y_838nuGo_1	WHICH I WAS NOT EXCITED TO SEE
PZ-lDQFboO8_4	UH EVEN THE KIDS IN THE AUDIENCE ITSELF JUST KIND OF CHUCKLED A LITTLE BIGGER A FEW LAUGHS
_dI--eQ6qVU_24	THEY TOOK A NEW SPIN ON IT AND
OQvJTdtJ2H4_8	AND DEFINITELY NOT A 3D MOVIE
HEsqda8_d0Q_28	MY FAVOURITE FILM EVER
Af8D0E4ZXaw_12	LOVE GEOFFREY RUSH AND MICHAEL CLARKE DUNCAN AS THE VOICE ACTORS
phBUpBr1hSo_17	UM THE ACTION WAS GREAT YOU KNOW NOT TOO MUCH NOT TOO LITTLE JUST JUST ENOUGH ACTION
1DmNV9C1hbY_10	KIDS ARE GOING TO LOVE THE FILM
9T9Hf74oK10_17	ANDREW GARFIELD OF COURSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM FROM THE SOCIAL NETWORK

ob23OKe5a9Q_9	[UNK]
vyB00TXsimI_17	AND THERE IS A BETTER ON TOP OF THE TRAIN FIGHT THAN THE FIRST MISSION IMPOSSIBLE MOVIE
Bfr499ggo-0_21	THE STORYLINE ISNT
9T9Hf74oK10_22	BUT ITS UM ITS SOMEWHAT MODERN I WOULD SAY
Nzq88NnDkEk_25	UH FROM MY REVIEW IM GONNA SAY IM GONNA GIVE IT TWO THUMBS DOWN RELEASED
LSi-o-IrDMs_3	I ACTUALLY DID NOT FIND THIS SERIES TO BE VERY FUN POPCORN AND A MOVIE
7JsX8y1ysxY_2	UM SOME REALLY GOOD ACTING
1iG0909rllw_16	I MEAN THE ENTIRE 23 OF IT IS UM BELLA SWAN KRISTEN KRISTEN STEWART CHARACTER MOVING AROUND COMPLETELY DEPRESSED
rnaNMUZpvvg_8	ALL THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST SO HONORED
BvYR0L6f2Ig_9	FIRST IM GOING TO GET INTO THE ACTING WHICH WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE SECOND ONE
jUzDDGyPkXU_18	THERE IS NO GOOD DIALOGUE NOTHING
1DmNV9C1hbY_14	I DIDNT CARE FOR IT BUT
iiK8YX8oH1E_10	WE SECOND GUESS OURSELVES
8d-gEyoeBzc_5	UM
8qrpnFRGt2A_14	ABOUT TWO HOURS WAS WAY TOO LONG FOR THIS MOVIE
etzxEpPuc6I_2	THE DUDE THAT MADE THE TECHNOLOGY IS I I CANT BRING THEM WITH YOU
iiK8YX8oH1E_2	NOW THE REAL STAR OF SOMETHING BORROWED IS JENNIFER GOODWIN
9T9Hf74oK10_6	AND IT WAS IT WAS THOUGHTFUL BUT THERE ARE
d6hH302o4v8_3	HES ALWAYS IN THESE KIND OF MOVIES ALL THESE SOURCES FOR WHICH BUCHANAN MOVIES
d3_k5Xpfmik_13	IT REALLY IS GOOD I MEAN
0h-zjBukYpk_5	THAT BEFORE WE GO ON WITH THAT I MUST SAY THAT THIS HAD A SURPRISINGLY DECENT CAST
Vj1wYRQjB-o_2	IT ALSO HAS A REALLY COOL GUY AND SAID ITS LIKE A DESERT EAGLE BUT IT HAS TWO BARRELS TO IT
Clx4VXItLTE_7	UM BOTH
HEsqda8_d0Q_25	I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHER PEOPLE ITS TRUE
POKffnXeBds_7	FUNNY I MEAN THE MOVIE WAS I GUESS IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME
Ci-AH39fi3Y_10	ONE OF THEM WAS GREAT
G-xst2euQUc_9	UM I THOUGHT THE STORYLINE WAS REALLY CUTE AND
d6hH302o4v8_6	WILL TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY
GWuJjcEuzt8_7	CAUSE WHEN YOU SEE HER FACE MOVES IT FEELS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU FEEL WORRIED FOR YOU
f9O3YtZ2VfI_17	AH AND IF YOURE GOING TO DO MOSTLY C D I JUST MAKE AN ANIMATED MOVIE
X3j2zQgwYgE_6	TO RUSH OUT AND SEE
VCslbP0mgZI_1	SO
Bfr499ggo-0_13	NOT EVEN NECESSARY TO THE PLOT
1DmNV9C1hbY_6	UH I SAW NO REASON WHY THEY NEED TO BRING BACK THE VILLAIN FROM THE FIRST ONE

9qR7uwkblbs_5	I THINK THAT THEY PERSONALLY THOUGHT RACHEL WHITEHURST REALLY FUCKING LOVE SUITS AND RYAN GOSLING SO THEY MADE THIS MOVIE WITH ME IN MY LIFE
8d-gEyoeBzc_26	IT PICKS UP SPAIN AND NEVER LETS GO EVEN IN EVEN IN THE THINGS LIKE WHERE THEY THEY THEY THEY SLOW DOWN AND YOU KNOW THEYRE MEANT TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE AND TALK ABOUT WHATS GOING ON YOU YOU KNOW
v0zCBqDeKcE_12	I MEAN HE EVEN FAKED HAVING AIDS TO GET OUT OF PRISON
9T9Hf74oK10_7	THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERE ARE CRITICS OF MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES TOO THOUGHTFUL IN A WAY AND I THINK THAT WOULD NEVER LET ME GO
cW1FSBF59ik_16	I LOVE SAVE A TOOTH IN THIS MOVIE

BI97DNYfe5I_22	IT IS FUNNY ITS A FUNNY MOVIE
nbWiPyCm4g0_4	FIRST LET ME JUST SAY I SAW QUITE A FEW GUYS AT THE CINEMA WHO CLEARLY BEEN DRAGGED THERE BY THEIR GIRLFRIENDS AND TO THOSE GUYS I SAY WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SELL YOUR BALLS BACK ON FOR YOU
yDtzw_Y-7RU_22	I ACTUALLY LIKE THE FILM
8OtFthrtaJM_18	DAMON IS A YOU KNOW HES A PRETTY FUNNY GUY
_dI--eQ6qVU_1	BUT I CAN SAFELY ASSURE YOU THAT EVEN IF THEY DIDNT IT WOULD STILL BE A HIT
VbQk4H8hgr0_17	THE DONKEY AND PUSS IN BOOTS A RIVALRY THATS GOING ON IT JUST IT WASNT AS FUNNY THE 3RD TIME AROUND
5W7Z1C_fDaE_8	AND REALLY WELL DONE

cW1FSBF59ik_24	FRED DUKES IS THE BLOG
f_pcplsH_V0_15	IM JUST KIND OF LIKE NOW THIS IS GOING TOO FAR
f9O3YtZ2VfI_22	LIKE I SAID BEFORE ITS A VERY INTERESTING IDEA
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_8	FOR A COUPLE OF FUNNY PARTS BUT
cXypl4FnoZo_15	UM WE HAD LIKE WE HAD GUESSED EVERYBODY UM THERES THIS RANDOM CHARACTER DUDE WHO WHAT DOES HE DO
f9O3YtZ2VfI_15	AND SCALE IT DOWN TO LIKE TWO HOURS
zhpQhgha_KU_27	IM VERY LATE FOR
cW1FSBF59ik_20	LIKE IN THIS I LOVE YOU
VbQk4H8hgr0_38	I MEAN IT PLAYS INTO THE STORY
bOL9jKpeJRs_10	A BAND OF OUTSIDERS
WKA5OygbEKI_16	REALLY THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE IS LISTENING TO HIM UP OFF ALL THESE DIFFERENT VOICES
bOL9jKpeJRs_21	AND THEN UH WHEN I QUESTION I PICKED IT UP AND I BROUGHT IT BACK HOME HE GOT RICH
ob23OKe5a9Q_11	[UNK]
Clx4VXItLTE_27	EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING AFTERWARDS
QN9ZIUWUXsY_14	I MEAN THIS MOVIE HAS THE MOST GORGEOUS VISUALS OUT OF ANY MOVIE SINCE PROBABLY AVATAR TO ME IF NOT PRETTIER
BvYR0L6f2Ig_14	THEY WERE JUST THEY JUST WERENT ACTING WERE THEY DOING ANYWAY
ZUXBRvtny7o_15	IS IT WAS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE MOVIE
f_pcplsH_V0_8	I THINK ITS HIGHLY UNDERRATED
OQvJTdtJ2H4_11	[UNK]
Jkswaaud0hk_7	SOME SCENES WHERE I THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN IN THE FILM OR THE EMOTION OF IT
HEsqda8_d0Q_33	I JUST WANTED TO PUT THIS UP SOON
5W7Z1C_fDaE_7	FROM THE WAY THAT ITS BEING RELEASED TO THE PERFORMANCES WITHIN IT TO THE STORY ITSELF IS ABSOLUTELY OVER THE TOP IMPRESSIVE
7JsX8y1ysxY_21	WHO WAS JUST KICK ASS A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME WAS THE GUY THAT PLAYED OUR WORSHIP
_dI--eQ6qVU_6	IT WAS REALLY REALLY FUNNY
Nzq88NnDkEk_26	FRANKLIN ON THIS MOVIE DONT GO SEE IT GO SEE SOMETHING ELSE HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON THATS ALL IM GONNA SAY ABOUT THAT SO
TvyZBvOMOTc_7	ITS A FAN SHAPED LIKE
pLTX3ipuDJI_16	IN FINALE I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR RENTAL NOT IN THE THEATER BECAUSE ITS A LOW GRADE SEQUEL TO THE 87 VERSION AND ONLY IF YOU LIKE THE SERIES
OtBXNcAL_lE_9	YOU KNOW I LIKE KATE HUDSON
8OtFthrtaJM_5	BUT THERES A REASON FOR THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR WHY I WAS CONFUSED
9qR7uwkblbs_7	I WISH I WAS RYAN GOSLING GOD
wMbj6ajWbic_20	UM AND OTHER PERFORMANCES ARE LIKE SOMETHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT
d6hH302o4v8_37	BORING
POKffnXeBds_3	YEAH SHE HAS A FAST IN TERMS OF WHITE GIRLS WELL I MEAN HER HOUSE REALLY ISNT THAT FAST
Vj1wYRQjB-o_8	UH THEY DID A GOOD JOB WITH THE CAR
I5y0__X72p0_38	THE MUSIC KIND OF DROVE A LOT OF THE ACTION
c7UH_rxdZv4_13	UH ITS JUST JACKASS
fvVhgmXxadc_13	KIND OF PLAYING WITH THE IDEA OF WHATS REAL WHATS NOT THAT THE MATRIX FILMS DID
6_0THN4chvY_10	UM THAT WAS PROBABLY THE PART IN THE TRAILER THAT GOT ME TO GO SEE THE MOVIE
2iD-tVS8NPw_20	BUT I THINK THERE WAS ALSO SOME SORT OF LIKE A TONE WITHIN THE ACTUAL POWERS OF THE GREEN LANTERN HIMSELF AND THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY THINK OF ANYTHING AND YOU CAN PROJECT THAT INTO THE REAL LIFE
LSi-o-IrDMs_26	WERE GOING TO GET BURNED OUT AS AS AS A SOCIETY ONE
aiEXnCPZubE_27	THEY ARE UNIQUE INCREDIBLY
HEsqda8_d0Q_11	THE ANIMATION WAS AMAZING TO WATCH
BvYR0L6f2Ig_2	I THOUGHT THE FIRST ONE WAS CREATIVE AND INVENTIVE AND REALLY BROUGHT SOMETHING NEW TO THE CINEMA
ZUXBRvtny7o_3	BUT I WENT AND I DID THIS MOVIE
9qR7uwkblbs_4	SO ANYWAY THE MOVIE WAS REALLY FUCKING AWESOME
OQvJTdtJ2H4_14	THATS HOW I THOUGHT A GIANT SCORPION WOULD LOOK WITH A PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD THAT HAD BLUE FIRE ON IT
1iG0909rllw_5	BUT SYSTEMATICALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD QUITE GOOD
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_3	IT WAS A COOL MOVIE
6Egk_28TtTM_9	LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MY BROTHER IS FIVE YEARS OLD AND HE DIDNT THINK THIS MOVIE WAS SCARY AT ALL
9J25DZhivz8_20	[UNK]
nbWiPyCm4g0_7	WHERE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT LIES NOT ENTIRELY SURE
WKA5OygbEKI_21	BUT UH IT WAS WORTH THE FREE MOVIE PASSES THEY USED ON IT
BioHAh1qJAQ_13	AND ONCE SAM FLYNN ENTERS THE GRID YOU KNOW THE SOUNDTRACK DRAWS YOU IN
8qrpnFRGt2A_15	AND THE LAST BIG THING WAS JUST IT IT I KNOW ITS ABOUT G I JOE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ITS GOING TO BE ABOUT THE ARMY BUT IT JUST FELT LIKE A LIKE AH MILITARY PROPAGANDA KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_15	UH I THINK IT WAS OKAY MOVIE
HEsqda8_d0Q_34	WERE AT A DISASTROUS SO ENJOY
WKA5OygbEKI_18	UM I WOULD YEAH I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS BUT
wMbj6ajWbic_19	SO YOU KNOW ITS NOT LIKE YOURE ACTUALLY GETTING LIKE CARRYING WATER QUALITY ACTING PERFORMANCES
9T9Hf74oK10_3	I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY SPLIT ABOUT THIS MOVIE
aiEXnCPZubE_6	VISUALLY STUNNING
c7UH_rxdZv4_10	SOMETHING THAT JUST KIND OF MAKES THEM SO SLIGHTLY ENDEARING EVEN THOUGH THEYRE KIND OF A JACKASS YOU KNOW YOU
LSi-o-IrDMs_11	BUT NONE OF THOSE THINGS MATTER ITS A FUN MOVIE ANYWAY
Iu2PFX3z_1s_3	HE TAKES GREAT ACTORS OR ACTRESSES IN THIS CASE LIKE SUPERHEROES AND AND CATE BLANCHETT
jUzDDGyPkXU_3	VERY REMINISCENT OF DISTRICT NINE IN
Oz06ZWiO20M_4	I WOULD SAY I I ENJOYED SACRIFICES
2WGyTLYerpo_18	ALIENS ARE REALLY COOL
OQvJTdtJ2H4_9	PREVIEWS OR MUCH MORE 3D THAN IT AND SO YEAH IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING
wMbj6ajWbic_6	IN THE GOOD WAY I MEAN THERES THERES TWO TYPES OF CHEESY AND THIS IS THE GOOD KIND OF CHEESY YES IT IS
9c67fiY0wGQ_4	I ALSO LIKE TO TELL THE STORY LINE OF THE MOVIE WORK TOGETHER SMOOTHLY
0h-zjBukYpk_22	AND I THOUGHT HE MADE A GOOD ACTOR FOR THE DEAD POOL CHARACTER
9c67fiY0wGQ_1	AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WOULD APPEAL MORE TO A YOUNGER AUDIENCE
Njd1F0vZSm4_4	AND THE OWLS ARE REALLY WONDERFUL AND
nzpVDcQ0ywM_3	AND ITS REALLY GLOSSED OVER WITH LOTS OF STUNNING SPECIAL EFFECTS AND BIG EXPLOSIONS
I5y0__X72p0_2	AT FIRST WHEN I SAW THE PREVIEWS I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE STUPID TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
nbWiPyCm4g0_5	ALSO IF YOURE A STRAIGHT MAN AND YOU VOLUNTARILY WILLINGLY GO AND SEE THIS FILM IM GONNA NEED YOU TO LIGHT A CANDLE SAY A PRAYER AND ASK YOURSELF SOME QUESTIONS
1DmNV9C1hbY_4	IT REMINDED ME OF GETTING UP ON A SATURDAY MORNING AND EATING FRUIT LOOPS AND WATCHING CARTOONS
atnd_PF-Lbs_14	THERE ARE ABOUT TWO CREATIVE SCENES IN HERE UH ONE BEING IN INTESTINAL JOURNEY THROUGH THE RECTUM IN A SWIMMING POOL DRAIN AND A TIRED A CAPITATION
2WGyTLYerpo_36	ITS AN ACCENT PRETTY CONVINCING
5W7Z1C_fDaE_1	PROBABLY ONE OF THE BALLS USED FILMS OF SUNDANCE 2011
yDtzw_Y-7RU_1	BUT LET ME FIRST SAY THIS I LIKED IT MORE THAN I EXPECTED I WOULD
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_7	I DIDNT FIND ALL THAT GOOD
f9O3YtZ2VfI_11	JUST NEED TO CUT THAT OUT
9qR7uwkblbs_28	COME ROUND THE CLOCK IM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF FOR NOT REALIZING THE TWIST BEFORE IT ACTUALLY TWISTED BECAUSE
BI97DNYfe5I_16	UM THE ACTING WAS WAS PRETTY GOOD
G6GlGvlkxAQ_3	I THINK THAT WILL DO VERY WELL
Vj1wYRQjB-o_9	TO TAKE A JOB WITH THE FIGHT SCENES
1iG0909rllw_8	I THOUGHT THE FILM WAS AWFUL
W8NXH0Djyww_32	UM DEFINITELY CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE RAIN GO UH IN A THEATER NEAR YOU
BioHAh1qJAQ_8	THE BEST SUMMER MOVIE IVE SEEN ALL YEAR
vvZ4IcEtiZc_10	AND ITS SORT OF LIKE A CONTRIVED PLOT THATS BEEN USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
Nzq88NnDkEk_32	REALLY FORWARD TO SEEING THAT MOVIE SO
BioHAh1qJAQ_18	ALL THOSE ACTION SEQUENCES INVOLVING THE GAMES WERE GREAT TO WATCH UH
QN9ZIUWUXsY_17	IT DOESNT MAKE MUCH SENSE I KNOW
2iD-tVS8NPw_30	ITS NOT LIKE THE GREEN LANTERN IS THE NEXT BATMAN BEGINS OR THE DARK KNIGHT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_22	BUT LIKE THATS KIND OF DEPRESSING
cXypl4FnoZo_9	SO THE MORE WOMEN DIRECTORS THAT I SEE YOU KNOW I I I LIKE SEEING THAT
k5Y_838nuGo_13	AND IT JUST WAS BETTER MAYBE ITS THE BABY
bOL9jKpeJRs_5	[UNK]
03bSnISJMiM_1	IT WAS REALLY GOOD
8OtFthrtaJM_20	OVERALL OVERALL IT HAD FAR TOO MANY PLOT HOLES AND
WKA5OygbEKI_3	UM I LIKED A LOT OF THE MOVIE
8OtFthrtaJM_2	JUST ITS VERY ITS VERY CHAOTIC AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE I
tStelxIAHjw_10	I DIDNT THINK IT WAS SAD
k5Y_838nuGo_6	THE FIRST TWO WERE PRETTY EXCELLENT
8d-gEyoeBzc_17	UM I LIKE THE RUSSIAN GUY UH YOURE RIGHT I THINK
2WGyTLYerpo_60	GOING TO GIVE IT AN 8 OUT OF 10
VbQk4H8hgr0_30	AND JUST AS THEY ARE WITH ALL THE OTHER SEQUELS THAT ARE COMING OUT ON THIS ONE
I5y0__X72p0_36	WASNT IT WASNT THE USUAL
_dI--eQ6qVU_4	BUT JUST GOING INTO THIS UH AS AN OBSERVER AND SOMEONE WHO HAS NO IDEA IT WAS A FANTASTIC FILM IT WAS SO MUCH FUN
VbQk4H8hgr0_16	AND HE WASNT EVEN THAT GREAT THIS TIME AROUND
LSi-o-IrDMs_4	CANT WALK IN EXPECTING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT
8d-gEyoeBzc_2	BUT IM ALSO GOING TO GIVE THE REASONS WHY I DONT THINK ITS GONNA BE A CLASSIC IN THE SAME VEIN AS THE FIRST MOVIE PREDATOR OR ALIENS
BioHAh1qJAQ_2	UM I THOUGHT THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO HAVE A TRANS EQUALITY BECAUSE
BXuRRbG0Ugk_26	AND THE CAST IS PRETTY WELL ROUNDED OUT WITH SUPPORTING PERFORMANCES FROM GUYS LIKE SAM ROCKWELL AS THE DARK
_dI--eQ6qVU_16	SURE ITS FUN TO SEE A SUPERHERO GO ROUND KICK BAD GUY BUT YOU KNOW PUNCH KICK WHATEVER MAAM
BXuRRbG0Ugk_18	AND THE ACTION WASNT THE MOST MEMORABLE THING ABOUT ANY OF THOSE MOVIES
7JsX8y1ysxY_28	VERY DARK
Sqr0AcuoNnk_15	THE LADY WHO PLAYS JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE SISTER UM ALTHOUGH SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN THIS MOVIE
7JsX8y1ysxY_38	UM SO AT THE END THERES NOT REALLY A WHOLE LOT OF REDEEMING VALUE THAT I THINK YOU COME UP WITH
BvYR0L6f2Ig_3	BOOK THE SECOND ONE IT DID IN SOME WAYS TAKE TO THE NEXT LEVEL
Njd1F0vZSm4_11	THEY REALLY NEEDED TO SOMEHOW SET THEM APART WITH ARMOR
BXuRRbG0Ugk_30	COWBOYS AND ALIENS PROBLEM IS THE SCREENPLAY SIX
HEsqda8_d0Q_2	THE PRAYER ITSELF WAS REALLY COOL
cXypl4FnoZo_13	UM I I DONT LIKE WELL I DONT KNOW IF I WANNA SAY I DONT LIKE THIS BUT I WISH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT WHO THE WOLF ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE
1DmNV9C1hbY_2	UM I LOVED THE VERY FIRST ALBUM AND THE CHIPMUNK MOVIE BECAUSE
73jzhE8R1TQ_15	IN MY OPINION HE SHOULDNT HAVE AND IPHONE IS SHIT CARE ABOUT THE LATEST TRENDS SO THATS REALLY WHAT BUGS ME TENDER
tIrG4oNLFzE_17	SO THATS PROBABLY WHY SHE JUST LOOKED THE SAME AND EVERYTHING WITHIN THOSE POLLED ABOUT TWO THINGS I ACTUALLY THOUGHT YES SHE IS THIS IS HER ACTING IS GOOD SHE CAN DO THIS
1iG0909rllw_27	UM AND MICHAEL SHEEN IS THERE AS WELL HE WAS HE WAS REALLY ENJOYABLE TO WATCH
HEsqda8_d0Q_32	ILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT LIKE THE COOL PREMIERE AND STUFF
POKffnXeBds_10	I MEAN HER ACTING IS LIKE SO SO AND I CANT BELIEVE SHE EVEN WON AN OSCAR BELIEVE SHE WON AN OSCAR FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS AND BEST ACTOR SOMETHING
Af8D0E4ZXaw_10	AND SECONDLY BECAUSE IT WAS A MARVEL GEEK I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY FAIR SHARE OF DISAPPOINTMENTS OVER THE LAST DECADE AND I CAN GENUINELY SAY THAT
aiEXnCPZubE_8	OVERALL BROWNING IS JUST FAILS TO DELIVER IT
Bfr499ggo-0_6	A FEW TIMES I DIDNT LIKE THE FASHION
Af8D0E4ZXaw_7	ALL THE GREEN LANTERN FANS OUT THERE I AM SO SORRY AND I
2WGyTLYerpo_8	THE VISUAL EFFECTS ARE PRETTY COOL
wMbj6ajWbic_30	MOVIE IS HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW
atnd_PF-Lbs_15	SOCIETY GRAVITATION ONE MIGHT NOT SOUND ALL THAT UNIQUE
Jkswaaud0hk_14	STORYLINE WAS OKAY
7JsX8y1ysxY_14	UM WHAT SUCKED WAS BAD WAS MILLIONAIRE AND THE GIRL PLAYS THE SILK SPECTRE II UH JUNIOR
9J25DZhivz8_18	THERE IS A ROLLER COASTER SCENE AND YOU ARE UM GET A LITTLE BIT MOTION SICK YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO SEE IT IN 3D BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE YOURE ON THIS COASTER
73jzhE8R1TQ_9	GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THING WITH LOREAN THE MUGGER DORIANS THE NUMBER
etzxEpPuc6I_4	THE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS LIKE UH I WANNA COMPARE THE TRANSFORMERS II AND I ACTUALLY DID
Bfr499ggo-0_4	JUST GO IN WITH LOW EXPENSES
BvYR0L6f2Ig_7	UM BUT SOME OF THE BRUSH PLOT THAT YOU MAY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE BUT YOURE WRONG ACTUALLY I DID MY
BI97DNYfe5I_4	UM BUT IT WAS STILL A GOOD FILM
8OtFthrtaJM_8	THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS CONSTANTLY COMPARING IT TO INCEPTION
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_2	OVERALL AND GO SEE IT
fvVhgmXxadc_11	AND LATER TIME SHE GOES LIKE A WORLD WAR II BATTLEFIELD UH CASTLE JUST KIND OF PULLED OUT OF THE RINGS
BI97DNYfe5I_26	UM BUT YEAH SO THE GREEN HORNET IT WAS OKAY
I5y0__X72p0_33	THE SOUNDTRACK WAS INTERESTING
IumbAb8q2dM_2	[UNK]
QN9ZIUWUXsY_13	BUT WHAT IT LACKS IN THOSE AREAS IN MOST DEFINITELY MAKES UP FOR JUST LIKE SHARE VISUAL SPECTACLE
W8NXH0Djyww_31	UM EVERYTHING ELSE HELD UP ITS OWN
lXPQBPVc5Cw_20	UM YEAH SO WE WERE OUT FROM WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT I WAS TESTING I JUST LIKE I HAD I HAD NO DRAW TO ME
ZAIRrfG22O0_3	THERE WERE A FEW FUNNY LINES

Sqr0AcuoNnk_12	HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS EVER
c7UH_rxdZv4_16	JUST BORING
OtBXNcAL_lE_1	AND A GUY WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE TOM CRUISE
2WGyTLYerpo_39	FIRST HES JUST KIND OF LIKE A GRUMPY OLD GUY BUT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_8	[UNK]
bvLlb-M3UXU_21	SEEING IT TODAY NOW WHERE IT WAS REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN JUST ONE UPSMANSHIP
c5xsKMxpXnc_7	THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE FOR THESE REASONS
W8NXH0Djyww_18	THIS WAS THIS WAS A REALLY COOL ACTION SEQUENCES WERE LIKE THIS RONNIE UH JOHNNY DEPP POSSE THEY WERE GETTING CHASED BY ALL THESE LIKE POSSUMS ARE
dq3Nf_lMPnE_8	FOUR MISSES OUT ON THE MAGIC THAT MADE THE FIRST FILM A REAL JOY TO VIEW
atnd_PF-Lbs_18	SO SICK AND OH MY GOD THAT WAS CRAZY THAT KIND OF SICK THERE
_dI--eQ6qVU_18	AND ADD SOMETHING LIKE AN EXTRA SPARK IN THERE
yDtzw_Y-7RU_23	UM I ENJOYED MYSELF IN IT YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
LSi-o-IrDMs_21	[UNK]
LSi-o-IrDMs_10	THE UH CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IS NIL
pLTX3ipuDJI_13	JUST LIKE WHEN A GIRL TELLS THE EXACT STORY OF THE FIRST MOVIE
d6hH302o4v8_7	WHEN HE WAS ON SCREEN I WANTED TO PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE
OtBXNcAL_lE_4	STAND MOVIES THAT ARE SO PREDICTABLE
8d-gEyoeBzc_19	AND THE GRAND DEATH ROW WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER
MLal-t_vJPM_18	OTHER THAN THOSE TWO THINGS
f_pcplsH_V0_9	I HATE SCREAM THREE BUT
OQvJTdtJ2H4_16	THE BEST PART ABOUT THE MOVIE I GOT A FREE PAIR OF GLASSES
2WGyTLYerpo_46	SHES ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
VbQk4H8hgr0_44	IT WAS BORING
bvLlb-M3UXU_19	HE WAS ALONE KNOWING THESE GUYS ARENT IN SHAPE THEY WERE 20 25 YEARS AGO
ZUXBRvtny7o_17	I MEAN THE BLOOD IS LIKE DRY LIGHT WITH SOME SATISFY WITH SOME ACTION AND WED LIKABLE CHARACTERS AND THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT GUYS
2WGyTLYerpo_27	THE ALIENS WERE REALLY COOL LOOKING
Iu2PFX3z_1s_5	UM WHATS REALLY NEAT ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THE CHEMICAL BROTHERS TO THE SOUND TRACKS WITH PULSE POUNDING THE ENTIRE WAY THROUGH
BioHAh1qJAQ_28	AND KU HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IDIOTIC VILLAINS EVER CAUSE WHAT IS WHAT IS COOL
BvYR0L6f2Ig_21	HAVE NOT SEEN ONE BAD MOVIE THAT SHES BEEN IN
2WGyTLYerpo_48	LESSON FOUR IS HERE
Dg_0XKD0Mf4_12	THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE HOUSE THINKING THIS ISNT AS BAD AS IVE HEARD AND IT WASNT
G6GlGvlkxAQ_11	THEY DID VERY WELL TO ESTABLISH THE CHARACTER OF THOR
yDtzw_Y-7RU_9	UM ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS IN ITS DEVOTION IS THAT SOMETIMES MY CHILDREN COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHATS BEING SAID BECAUSE THEY WERE SPEAKING DICK AND SONY IN ENGLISH
WKA5OygbEKI_9	WELL ITS A JOHNNY DEPP MOVIE SO ITS ENTERTAINING BUT
Sqr0AcuoNnk_2	I THERE WERE TIMES IN THE MOVIE WHERE I FELT REALLY BORED

QN9ZIUWUXsY_12	BASICALLY A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT I CRITIQUE A MOVIE ON ITS REALLY WOBBLY
Ci-AH39fi3Y_22	AND I GUESS THATS SORT OF TRUE BECAUSE
k5Y_838nuGo_4	I LIKE THE FIRST TWO STRIKES QUITE A BIT

BioHAh1qJAQ_30	AND ITS LIKE DUDE YOURE A COMPUTER PROGRAM OKAY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD USING REAL PEOPLE IS THE WORST WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT INFILTRATE SOME COMPUTER SYSTEMS SOMEWHERE AND DETONATE SOME
Qr1Ca94K55A_4	ONE THE REAL STAR OF THIS MOVIE WAS MILLION FEATURES CHARACTER OR WILL IT FINISH UP
etzxEpPuc6I_15	NO ONE IS HALF THE BATTLE
v0zCBqDeKcE_11	AND JIM CARREY UM I KIND OF THE LIGHT WENT OFF I LOVE ARE USED TO IMITATE HIS COMEDY STYLE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BELIEVE IT OR NOT
c7UH_rxdZv4_19	YOU CANT EVEN TELL FUNNY JOKES

Clx4VXItLTE_14	UM BOTH REALLY GOOD LIKE
8d-gEyoeBzc_3	[UNK]
VbQk4H8hgr0_6	I MEAN I WENT IN THERE HOPING TO SEE SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND FUNNY LIKE THE FIRST TWO AND
c5xsKMxpXnc_15	YOU DONT SEE WHY THEY SHOULD LIKE EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY DONT SHOW IT IN THE MOVIES
nzpVDcQ0ywM_20	HE IS AVERAGE
VbQk4H8hgr0_11	REALLY THAT FUNNY
bvLlb-M3UXU_15	HE IS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE FOR A MAN TWICE MY AGE WHO LOOKS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN ME THATS
tIrG4oNLFzE_14	OKAY SHES STARING WAS SHE THINKING HOW SHE FELT I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS THE SAME EXPRESSION OF SHOCK OF SADNESS FOR WHAT CONSUMERS SHOULD BE SAD BUT IT IT REALLY BUGS ME
HEsqda8_d0Q_27	BUT IM JUST GOING TO HAVE TO SAY

X3j2zQgwYgE_11	OK AND NOW ITS LATE
2WGyTLYerpo_13	[UNK]
aiEXnCPZubE_10	THE SUPPORTING CAST IS EITHER HIT OR MISS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_11	LIES WITH YOU BEFORE I GET TO THE NEGATIVES OF THE MOVIE LET ME LIST OFF A FEW OF THE POSITIVES
G-xst2euQUc_6	WAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_14	DID SEEM TO FOCUS TOO MUCH ON EPIC EPIC EPIC
yvsjCA6Y5Fc_1	OF ROBIN HOOD STARRING RUSSELL CROWE UH FIRST THING I GOTTA SAY RIGHT OFF THE BAT I WAS DREADING GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE
9c67fiY0wGQ_6	I ALSO THOUGHT SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE WERE FUNNY FOR EXAMPLE UM GAGA MOST CATS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
Ci-AH39fi3Y_40	BUT ILL SMACK HIM IN THE FACE FOR THE OTHER IRRELEVANT PLOT LINE
G6GlGvlkxAQ_5	I THINK THAT ACCOUNTABLE CHRIS HANDS WITH BEING A BIGGER STAR
jUzDDGyPkXU_22	MOMENTS WHERE HE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST SOUNDED DUMB AS HELL
9c67fiY0wGQ_7	THEY ARE SO HILARIOUS AND SIMILAR TO HOW A PERSON WOULD ACT
OQvJTdtJ2H4_7	BIG SCENE IT MAY BE LESS ABOUT THEM JANET
d6hH302o4v8_22	IT WAS REALLY MADE WELL
d3_k5Xpfmik_4	IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT YOU REALLY CANT TRUST ANYONE IN THIS SITUATION
Af8D0E4ZXaw_26	I DONT EVEN KNOW WHERE I REALLY SHOULD BEGIN WHEN LISTING OFF THE NEGATIVES BUT IM GOING TO START WITH A FEW OF THE SUPERFICIAL THINGS
7JsX8y1ysxY_9	IT WAS FUNNY THOUGH
nzpVDcQ0ywM_9	BUT IF YOU WERE A CHILD WHO GREW UP IN THAT TIME PERIOD YOURE NOT GOING TO ENJOY THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH BECAUSE
bvLlb-M3UXU_1	AND ITS REALLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT ITS NOT
nzpVDcQ0ywM_24	HE DELIVERS A LOT OF INTENSITY
BioHAh1qJAQ_9	BUT YOU KNOW THE PACING IS SO GOOD
bvLlb-M3UXU_8	IS A BAD GUY GOTTA GO TAKE THEM OUT THATS REALLY ALL YOU NEED
Oz06ZWiO20M_5	I WAS MORE ENTERTAINED BY IT THAN BATTLE LA WHICH WAS JUST A SLUG AND BORING AND I JUST FOUND IT TOTALLY UNINTERESTING
ZUXBRvtny7o_34	SO YEAH IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN THIS WEEKEND WILL WATCH IT WATCH THIS MOVIE
tmZoasNr4rU_14	IT WAS JUST THERE UH I WASNT I WASNT AMUSED
Ci-AH39fi3Y_7	EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
9c67fiY0wGQ_5	[UNK]
c5xsKMxpXnc_3	THEY TALK FOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES IN THE INSTANT CASE WHICH IS DUMB
9J25DZhivz8_9	THE VOICE ACTING IN THIS WAS INCREDIBLE
pLTX3ipuDJI_8	WHAT DISAPPOINTED ME WAS THAT ONE OF THE MOST HIJACKERS IN THE MOVIE WAS ONLY IN IT FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
lXPQBPVc5Cw_19	THE TWO OTHERS WERE JUST BORED
I5y0__X72p0_1	AND I WAS PRETTY OPENED TO IT BEING GOOD
tmZoasNr4rU_6	THE ACTION AND HUMOR WERE MOSTLY FLAT
2WGyTLYerpo_14	SO LIKE CRAZY
8OtFthrtaJM_19	JUST ASIDE FROM THAT THEY REALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THE SUSPENSEFUL PARTS
Af8D0E4ZXaw_17	AND UM FINALLY A PARTICULAR STANDOUT SCENE FOR ME WAS THE FIGHTER JET SEQUENCES
k5Y_838nuGo_9	UH WHICH ACTUALLY WAS REALLY GOOD
Njd1F0vZSm4_7	BUT THE STORY IS VERY DARK
fvVhgmXxadc_2	BUT UNFORTUNATELY ITS JUST AN UGLY LOUD VIOLENT INVOLVING AND SADISTIC EXERCISE THAT I
cM3Yna7AavY_16	OH GOD WHY DID I WATCH THAT MOVIE
QN9ZIUWUXsY_7	TRON LEGACY IS A MOVIE WHERE ON MOST COUNTS THAT I JUDGE MOVIES IT KIND OF FAILS
ZAIRrfG22O0_5	THE MOVIE THEATER GAVE ME A CREDIT TO THE FUTURE MOVIES THAT I APPRECIATE IT
VbQk4H8hgr0_3	AND I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT THIS WILL BE JUST AS GOOD
phBUpBr1hSo_11	I LOVE MY MOVIES TO BE LONG
ZUXBRvtny7o_4	I WAS HAPPY TO SEE IT
c5xsKMxpXnc_13	LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BUT NONE WHERE THESE TWO SHOULD BE TOGETHER
G-xst2euQUc_18	AND WE REALLY WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE UM LAST NIGHT YESTERDAY WAS EASY
cXypl4FnoZo_12	UM I SAY GO SEE IT BECAUSE I ENJOYED IT NOW UM
PZ-lDQFboO8_7	EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THE TRAILER ITSELF IS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE HUMOR YOURE GONNA SEE IN THE MOVIE
G-xst2euQUc_15	ANYWAY UM I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF IF YOURE LIKE ME AND YOU DONT NORMALLY GO TO SEE ANIMATED MOVIES
c7UH_rxdZv4_4	I TRULY LOVE AN ACTION FLICK ACTION COMEDY FLICK EVEN BETTER RIGHT

BXuRRbG0Ugk_3	I MEAN IT WASNT A BAD YEAR BUT
phBUpBr1hSo_13	UM IM PASSIONATE ABOUT MOVIES SO THATS FINE
d3_k5Xpfmik_15	THE SEQUENCES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM WHICH FEATURES COLUMBUS EXPLAINING SOME OF THESE RULES TO SURVIVING A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE ARE REALLY WELL DONE
lXPQBPVc5Cw_26	DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANYMORE OF THIS
zhpQhgha_KU_18	THE MOST UPBEAT CHARACTER THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE
Iu2PFX3z_1s_10	BUT I THINK ITS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THATS SO UNIQUE
TvyZBvOMOTc_9	ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT COME TO STOP THEM GETTING TO THE DESTINATION ARE ALTHOUGH PLAUSIBLE LITTLE WEAK
5W7Z1C_fDaE_12	LEO WILL HAVE YOU CROPPED OUT TO INTERFERE WITH THE TINY LITTLE SMILE
Clx4VXItLTE_30	ITS KIND OF LIKE QUITE FAKE LIKE ITS JUST I COULDNT BELIEVE IT I WAS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING
PZ-lDQFboO8_2	BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS JUST A LITTLE DRY
zhpQhgha_KU_19	I THINK THAT UM EVERYBODY I DO FEEL REALLY BAD FOR CHARLOTTE
etzxEpPuc6I_13	BECAUSE ONE PART WITH THE GIRLS LIKE MY DADDY TAUGHT ME TO WIN WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE CAMERA LIKE WOW LIKE HIS ACTING IS PRETTY BAD
MLal-t_vJPM_5	PROBABLY THE BEST THING CURRENTLY IN THEATERS
Oz06ZWiO20M_13	I THINK ITS REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE A MUSICAL AND A
f9O3YtZ2VfI_1	WHATEVER THE NAME IS TOO LONG
Iu2PFX3z_1s_6	YOU NEVER KNOW WHATS GONNA HAPPEN
BI97DNYfe5I_24	BUT UM YEAH GO CHECK IT OUT ITS

9qR7uwkblbs_9	FUCKING SPOIL ANYTHING FOR YOU JUST BECAUSE LIKE THAT WOULD BE RUDE
tStelxIAHjw_5	AND I REALLY HATED CARS
PZ-lDQFboO8_12	BUT AS FAR AS KUNG FU PANDA GOES I WAS HOPING FOR A LOT MORE IT JUST WASNT THERE FOR ME I DONT KNOW
Jkswaaud0hk_13	HE ADDED A GREAT DIMENSION TO THE MOVIE AS WELL
ZUXBRvtny7o_20	UM TANNING IS OPEN FOR A SEQUEL
G6GlGvlkxAQ_21	YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH IT FAIRLY QUICKLY
VbQk4H8hgr0_41	IT JUST KIND OF MADE ME WANT TO REALLY WALK OUT OF THE THEATER
aiEXnCPZubE_9	AND IS UPSTAGED BY MANY OTHER PERFORMANCES IN THE FILM
2WGyTLYerpo_23	I DIDNT EXPECT THAT
7JsX8y1ysxY_8	WHAT WAS WEIRD WAS THE FACT THAT IN PART OF THE MOVIE HES WEARING A BLUE OVERALL SONG THING METAL PHONE THING SO I WAS LIKE WHY NOT WEAR THE WHOLE TIME YOU KNOW WHY WHY YOU GOTTA GO COMMANDO ON US
9J25DZhivz8_4	UH THE VOICE ACTING
zhpQhgha_KU_23	ITS JUST JUST ABOUT GETTING GETTING TIME FOR YOURSELF AND
etzxEpPuc6I_7	BUT THE THING ABOUT G I JOE COMPARED TO TRANSFORMERS TRANSFORMERS TWO DIDNT KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO DO LIKE
cXypl4FnoZo_10	SO UM I THOUGHT YOU DID GREAT WITH THIS MOVIE

ob23OKe5a9Q_12	[UNK]
jUzDDGyPkXU_24	I CANT WAIT TO READ THAT BUT LIKE UM I MEAN SURE THAT YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING REALLY THAT BAD ASS IN HIS MOVIES
k5Y_838nuGo_7	THE 3RD ONE IS A PIECE OF CRAP
6Egk_28TtTM_8	AND IT DEPENDS WHAT AGE YOU ARE AND HOW YOU TO HOW YOU FEEL LIKE SEEING THE MOVIE
I5y0__X72p0_13	ANYWAYS SKIPPING PAST THAT SHES GOT THIS LIKE KICK A ATTITUDE
Af8D0E4ZXaw_5	IT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF POTENTIALLY SETTING UP ALL THAT OTHER STUFF IN
8d-gEyoeBzc_16	I THOUGHT SHE WAS NEVER A WELL DRAWN OUT CHARACTER
G-xst2euQUc_8	GREAT FOR ALL AGES
WKA5OygbEKI_10	ITS NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD GO BY
OtBXNcAL_lE_13	CARE FOR ANY OF IT
aiEXnCPZubE_22	THEY ARE INTERESTING CHARACTERS
nzpVDcQ0ywM_14	HE DOES SOME STEREOTYPICAL THINGS LIKE TALKING ABOUT BUSTING A CAP WHILE FLYING AN AIRPLANE
BI97DNYfe5I_2	UM I WAS EXPECTING SETH ROGAN TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS IN THIS MOVIE BUT HE WAS
0h-zjBukYpk_11	HES THE STAR OF THE MOVIE
VbQk4H8hgr0_10	ITS NOTHING MAJOR NOTHING
W8NXH0Djyww_6	BUT IT WAS IT WAS COOL
POKffnXeBds_4	FIRST OF ALL THE MOVIE WAS BORING
aiEXnCPZubE_11	THE HITS INCLUDE OSCAR ISAAC AS THE MAIN VILLAIN LIKE I SAID BLUE GYM ALONE IS THE SOFT SPOKEN ROCKET AND THE SHOW STEALING ABBIE CORNISH IS SWEET PEA AT TROUBLED AND RELUCTANT YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PACK
W8NXH0Djyww_29	UM THE ONE THING I DIDNT LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THEY BROUGHT THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THE BAD CHARACTER I SHOULD SAY IN KIND OF LATE
9qR7uwkblbs_12	AND THEYRE JUST LIKE LIKE ZOOMING IN ON HIM AND IM JUST SITTING HERE LIKE A MOTHERFUCKING DROP
HEsqda8_d0Q_8	HES BEEN SUCH A GRUMPY CHARACTER AND HES REALLY SCARED AT THE END HES SO CHANGED AND ITS REALLY FUNNY
atnd_PF-Lbs_21	THE RACE STADIUM SCENE AND THE MALL SCENES IN THE BEGINNING OF THE END WHERE MASS AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE DIE IN THE CRAZIEST WAYS ARE PRETTY GOOD FOR LATE NIGHT BUDDY VIEWINGS AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY LATE NIGHT BUDDY
vvZ4IcEtiZc_4	UM THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT MOVIES THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR I MEAN UM THE KINGS SPEECH BLACK SWAN 127 HOURS INCEPTION
G6GlGvlkxAQ_29	[UNK]
